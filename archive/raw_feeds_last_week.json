    "content": "New insights into materials with differentiated pore structures are synthesized through precursor purification to investigate the rate\u2010performance failure mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHard carbons are considered to be the most promising anode materials for sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) because of their low cost and high sodium storage performance. However, the inadequate rate performance of hard carbon remains a critical bottleneck hindering high\u2010power applications of SIBs. Herein, we elucidate the key structural descriptors underlying the rate\u2010performance failure mechanism by constructing hard carbon with tailored microstructures, achieved via precise regulation of precursor composition. It is worth noting that the hard carbons engineered with the aforementioned differentiated structural design exhibit similar thermodynamic behaviors for sodium storage, but markedly different kinetic properties. At a current density of 2 A g\u22121, the reversible capacity of ABP\u2010L\u20101400 is 304.6 mAh g\u22121, which is 1.24 times of ABP\u2010H\u20101400. Systematic characterization reveals that the kinetic difference is primarily attributable to variations in low\u2010plateau capacity, with key influencing factors identified through in\u2010depth analysis as the uniform organic/inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase and the micro\u2010open pore structure. Additionally, practical applications can be extended to high\u2010power Prussian blue//hard carbon cylindrical cells, demonstrating a capacity of 702.2 mAh at 5 C. This work provides guidance for the design of advanced fast\u2010charging SIBs.",

The electrode achieves remarkable OER performance and durability, highlighting a practical pathway toward electronic structure\u2010engineered catalysts for large\u2010scale alkaline water electrolysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe sluggish kinetics of the multiple\u2010electron/proton oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a major bottleneck for alkaline water electrolysis. Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts is thus crucial for developing OER electrodes with superior activity and durability. Herein, we report a simple two\u2010step strategy to construct a magnetic free\u2010standing FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode, in which Fe doping effectively tailors the electronic spin structure of metal active sites, leading to remarkable OER activity. Specifically, the FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode delivers a low overpotential of 278 mV at 100 mA cm\u22122 and a small Tafel slope of 47.0 mV dec\u22121 in 1.0 m KOH. Remarkably, it maintains stable operation for over 900\u00a0h at 5000 A m\u22122 under high\u2010temperature and concentrated alkaline conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability and practical feasibility for industrial water electrolysis. Such superior performance originates from the high\u2010spin state of in situ formed metal (oxy)hydroxide active phase, which synergistically optimizes the adsorption\u2010desorption balance and electron transfer processes. This work offers a mechanistic investigation for regulating electronic spin structures via a doping strategy, paving the way for electronic\u2010engineered free\u2010standing electrodes toward industrial water electrolysis.",

This approach enables the first scalable 30 x 30 cm2 semi\u2010transparent solar module, highlighting its potential for building\u2010integrated and indoor photovoltaics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBalancing transparency and efficiency remains a key challenge for semi\u2010transparent perovskite solar cells (ST\u2010PSCs), restricting their application in building\u2010integrated photovoltaics and indoor electronics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy combining optical modelling, transparent electrode engineering, and molecular passivation to overcome this transparency\u2010efficiency trade\u2010off. Guided by transfer matrix simulations, a 1.7 eV FAMA\u2010based perovskite layer with a thickness of \u223c185 nm was integrated with an optimized MoO3/Au/MoO3 top electrode (59.9% transmittance).

Consequently, the champion ST\u2010PSC delivers 13.78% power conversion efficiency (PCE), 31.1% average visible transmittance (AVT), and a high light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.29%. Notably, this study demonstrates for the first time efficient indoor operation of ST\u2010PSCs, achieving 22.41% indoor PCE (iPCE) under 1000 lux LED illumination, and further realizes the first scalable 30 \u00d7 30\u00a0cm2 semi\u2010transparent module retaining 8.2% (7.4%) PCE under 1 sun (0.2 sun). The unencapsulated ST\u2010PSCs retain 79.6% of initial PCE after 268 h of continuous standard light soaking.

While hydrogen is widely promoted, its low volumetric energy density, complex storage requirements, and limited infrastructure readiness raise questions about scalability. This Perspective paper argues that aluminum deserves attention as a strategic energy carrier. With an exceptionally high volumetric energy density, global availability, and full recyclability, aluminum offers unique advantages for seasonal storage and sector coupling. We highlight the promising high\u2010temperature aluminum\u2013steam oxidation pathway, which produces both heat and hydrogen alongside \u03b3\u2010Al2O3, directly recyclable in decarbonized smelting processes. Beyond technical feasibility, we discuss system\u2010level opportunities, from coupling aluminum\u2010based storage with renewable\u2010powered smelting plants to enabling multi\u2010service energy hubs for electricity and mobility. Preliminary techno\u2010economic assessments show that aluminum\u2010based hybrid cycles can achieve round\u2010trip efficiencies of 30\u201336% in power\u2010to\u2010power applications and competitive levelized costs for electricity and hydrogen production in the power\u2010to\u2010X framework. Moreover, key performance indexes show aluminum\u2010based hydrogen aboveground storage can reach densities exceeding Clean Hydrogen targets by a factor of seven, with competitive CAPEX and OPEX values. These results highlight aluminum's potential to complement or outperform hydrogen in enabling reliable, high\u2010density, and fully recyclable energy storage within decarbonized energy systems.",

The resulting anode sustains industrial\u2010level OER at 2.0 A cm\u22122 for 4,000 h in 1.0 M KOH and efficiently drives AEM water electrolysis in strongly alkaline freshwater and natural seawater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh\u2212valent transition\u2212metal (oxy)hydroxides commonly demonstrated high intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrochemical self\u2212reconstruction. However, this evolution inevitably compromises structural integrity and long\u2212term durability at industrial current densities (>1 A cm\u22122). Here, we propose a sequential\u2212engineering strategy that separates catalytic\u2212site activation from surface reconstruction through the preconfiguring of a ligand\u2212hole\u2212rich (oxy)hydroxide. Combined structural and electrochemical analyses confirm that Fe3+ oxidizes L\u2212cysteine into a moderated sulfur donor, enabling precise S incorporation (avoiding sulfides, e.g., Ni3S2), along with Fe\u2212O\u2212Ni inductive polarization, biasing Ni2+ toward NiIII. In parallel, the preconfigured high NiIII strengthens Ni\u2500O covalency, while sulfur incorporation introduces ligand holes to O\u22122p band, thereby rendering lattice oxygen electrophilic. This pre\u2212establishing framework allows lattice\u2212oxygen to precede oxidation at Ni sites, affecting a kinetic decoupling that underpins durability. Consequently, the S\u2212NiFeOOH delivers overpotentials of 182 mV and 214 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively, while sustaining over 4000 hours of continuous operation at 2.0 A cm\u22122. In an anion\u2212exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it achieves 1 A cm\u22122 at 1.67 V (freshwater) and 1.74 V (seawater) and maintains stable performance beyond 3,500 hours at 1.0 A cm\u22122, underscoring its promise for large\u2212scale green hydrogen production.",

This review offers mechanistic insights into imperfectly matched Si/Gr hybrid anodes, elucidating heterogeneous lithiation behavior and interfacial failure pathways, and thereby informing the design of durable, high\u2010energy\u2013density lithium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSilicon/graphite (Si/Gr) anodes, integrating Si's ultrahigh specific capacity with Gr's structural stability and electrical conductivity, have emerged as the most promising high\u2010capacity systems for next\u2010generation lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). The synergy between Si and Gr enables a balance between energy density, cycling stability, and manufacturability, already demonstrated in commercial cells.

Although Gr can alleviate stress and maintain conductivity, mismatched electrochemical kinetics and mechanical properties between Si and Gr lead to heterogeneous lithiation and complex interfacial evolution, posing major engineering challenges. This review highlights recent advances in the mechanistic understanding and engineering optimization of Si/Gr anodes, emphasizing failure modes originating from both individual component degradation and interfacial coupling. The roles of advanced characterization and multiscale modeling in revealing volume effects and interfacial dynamics are discussed. Building on these insights, optimization strategies such as nanoscale structuring, interfacial engineering, buffered conductive frameworks, gradient architectures, electrode design, and pre\u2010lithiation are summarized.

    "content": "To overcome the thermodynamic instability and phase degradation of \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3, we employed a bimolecular coanchoring strategy based on 4\u2010[3\u2010(trifluoromethyl)\u20103H\u2010diazirin\u20103\u2010yl]benzoic acid and 2\u2010benzamidinyl\u20105\u2010guanidinopentanoic acid. This approach constructs a multiscale hydrogen\u2010bond network that simultaneously stabilizes FA\u207a and Pb2\u207a sites, enabling an improvement in perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 26.07% and exceptional thermal and photostability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nRecent advances in formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) solar cells have significantly improved their photoelectric conversion efficiency, positioning them as a leading candidate in third\u2010generation photovoltaics. However, their thermodynamic metastability\u2014driven by phase transitions from photoactive \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 to inactive \u03b4\u2010FAPbI3\u2014causes efficiency decay, hindering long\u2010term stability and industrialization. This study introduces a bimolecular synergistic anchoring strategy to address these challenges: a multiscale molecular interlocking network is constructed using 4\u2010[3\u2010(trifluoromethyl)\u20103H\u2010diazirin\u20103\u2010yl]benzoic acid (HDA) and 2\u2010benzamidinyl\u20105\u2010guanidinopentanoic acid (GS). HDA stabilizes formamidinium iodide (FAI) via carbene reactions, suppressing FA\u207a thermal escape, while GS binds under\u2010coordinated Pb2\u207a through its high dipole moment, minimizing lead leakage. Leveraging structural homology, these dual passivators synergistically stabilize A\u2010site (FA\u207a) and B\u2010site (Pb2\u207a) ions, forming a hydrogen\u2010bond network that optimizes crystal growth and enhances \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 phase stability and photothermal resilience. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) optimized with HDA\u2010GS achieve a record power conversion efficiency of 26.07%, along with exceptional operational stability: unencapsulated devices retain 95% of initial efficiency after 1300\u00a0h at 85\u00b0C under nitrogen (thermal stability) and 91% after 1500\u00a0h of continuous light exposure (light stability). This work demonstrates that a multi\u2010scale molecular interlocking network effectively overcomes perovskite inherent instability, offering a scalable pathway to high\u2010performance, durable PSCs.",

    "content": "This review comprehensively discusses the background and strategies for developing efficient and stretchable perovskite optoelectronics. This review covers an overview of features associated with mechanical deformation and characterization and various strategies utilized for other stretchable perovskite\u2010based optoelectronics. In addition, this review provides a research trend and suggest several issues and viewpoints about stretchable perovskite optoelectronics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAdvancing free\u2010form\u2010factor electronics is essential to broaden their applicability of electronics. In this regard, the development of stretchable semiconductors and their systems that offer both excellent stretchability with outstanding optoelectronic properties is imperative. Among various optoelectronic material candidates, metal\u2010halide perovskite has emerged as the most promising semiconductors owing to their high charge mobility, long exciton diffusion length and tunable bandgap. However, compared to stretchable organic\u2010based devices, stretchable perovskite devices have been rarely investigated because of perovskites\u2019 inherently low mechanical stretchability. In this regard, to develop stretchable perovskite optoelectronics, identifying the fundamental determinants of their low mechanical deformability and establishing of strategies to overcome these limitations are crucial. In this context, this paper presents the first in\u2010depth overview of stretchability characteristics of perovskite\u2010based optoelectronic device, highlighting key strategies for realizing next\u2010generation stretchable platforms from material and geometric perspectives. In detail, background on mechanical deformation behaviors of stretchable devices is provided. Subsequently, we examine reported studies on stretchable perovskite optoelectronic devices according to their materials and device structures. Finally, current challenges and important issues that remain unresolved but must be addressed to enable meaningful progress are discussed.",

    "content": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of vacuum\u2010based fabrication strategies for perovskite solar cells, with particular emphasis on precursor sublimability, stoichiometry control, and sublayer\u2010guided crystallization. By drawing direct comparisons with industrial organic light\u2010emitting diode (OLED) manufacturing, we emphasize both the opportunities and the remaining challenges associated with scalable, uniform multilayer device integration and commercialization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly advanced as a promising photovoltaic technology, achieving certified efficiencies exceeding 27% for single\u2010junction and 34% for tandem configurations. However, commercialization is hindered by solution\u2010based fabrication challenges, including solvent toxicity, interlayer damage, and poor large\u2010area uniformity. This review examines vacuum\u2010based dry processing as a scalable alternative, drawing parallels with the successful commercialization of organic light\u2010emitting diodes (OLEDs) via vacuum methods. We systematically analyzes dry fabrication of perovskite absorbers, classified by organic\u2010, inorganic\u2010, and hybrid\u2010 cations; charge transport layers, categorized by hole and electron transport layers with organic, inorganic, and hybrid variants; and fully dry\u2010processed PSCs. Key frameworks include precursor evaporability criteria, in situ stoichiometry control, and sublayer\u2010templated crystallization for uniform films and stable stacks. Extensive survey tables highlight photovoltaics in terms of their dry\u2010process methodologies used and resulting performances. This work concludes that by leveraging the multilayer precision and patterning expertise of OLEDs, dry\u2010processed PSCs offer enhanced reproducibility, environmental safety, and industrial viability, positioning them to overcome current bottlenecks toward widespread deployment.",

    "content": "A machine learning interatomic potential is introduced that enables rapid prediction of sodium\u2010ion conductivity in a wide range of glass electrolytes across 1,303 compositions. The study demonstrates how anion chemistry, particularly sulphides and halides, governs ion mobility, and identifies structural descriptors linked to ionic conductivity. The findings offer a data\u2010driven approach to designing high\u2010performance glassy solid electrolytes for batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGlass materials are promising candidates as solid electrolytes for batteries. However, the atomistic origins of variations in ionic conductivity with composition remain poorly understood. A key challenge in computationally designing high\u2010performance glass electrolytes is the absence of an efficient general interatomic potential, particularly for mixed\u2010anion systems, such as combinations of oxides, sulphides, and halides. To address these limitations, a machine learning interatomic potential for glass electrolytes is introduced, based on the atomic cluster expansion descriptor, covering common network formers, modifiers, and anions. Excellent agreement with experimental structure and property data across a wide range of glass compositions is observed. While the potential is broadly applicable to, e.g., lithium\u2010ion conductivity, focus is here on the influence of glass composition on sodium\u2010ion conductivity given the emerging importance of these conductors. By screening the diffusivity of 1,303 glass compositions, the presence of anion species, such as sulphides and halides, is found to have a large positive influence on diffusivity, enabling prediction of highly conductive glasses with mixed anions. Diffusivity and ionic conductivity are found to be highly correlated with a set of descriptors, such as the average atomic volume. This work thus helps to accelerate predictive modelling and broader understanding of conductivity in glass electrolytes.",

    "content": "A vacuum\u2010filtration method using polymer\u2010dopant suspensions enables rapid fabrication of tens\u2010of\u2010micrometers\u2010thick, uniformly doped polymer films. Excess dopants and short\u2010conjugated polymer chains are effectively removed during filtration, reducing structural and energetic disorder. These films are integrated into fingertip\u2010sized thermoelectric generators that operate electronic devices using body heat, achieving a record areal power density and offering a new, scalable leg fabrication strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nOptimization of leg dimensions, including thickness, is essential for maximizing output powers of thermoelectric (TE) generators. However, fabricating thick and uniform active films with conjugated polymers remains challenging, as doping processes are limited either by reduced solubility in polymer\u2010dopant blend solutions or by a trade\u2010off between dopant diffusion and doping stability. Here, a vacuum filtration method is introduced to fabricate tens\u2010of\u2010micrometers\u2010thick films within a few seconds by selectively collecting large, doped polymer particles from a polymer\u2010dopant suspension. The polymer particles form smooth, thick, uniformly doped, and highly flexible TE films via interparticle coalescence, while the short\u2010conjugated polymers and inactive dopants are effectively removed during filtration, thereby greatly enhancing the TE performance. The \u224860\u2010\u00b5m\u2010thick doped polymer films are integrated to fabricate fingertip\u2010sized TE generators, which exhibit high output powers up to 2.00 \u00b5W at \u0394T = 15.2 K, yielding a record\u2010high normalized areal power density (209 \u00b5W m\u22122 K\u22122) and enabling successful electronic device operations using body heat. It is believed that the vacuum filtration method offers a new experimental protocol for fabricating organic TE generators as well as for gaining deep insights into the effects of solution\u2010state doping on the electrical and structural properties of conjugated polymers.",

This modification enables durable all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries using Na anodes and NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state sodium batteries utilizing sulfide electrolytes and sodium (Na) anodes are promising for energy storage due to their safety and cost\u2010effectiveness. However, their practical implementation is significantly hindered by the interfacial degradation at Na3PS4|Na interface, while the resolution strategies remain scarce due to the unclear underlying mechanisms. Herein, operando synchrotron X\u2010ray computed tomography is utilized to reveal an electro\u2010chemo\u2010mechanical coupling failure mechanism. Our results demonstrate the formation of a 65\u2010\u00b5m\u2010thick side\u2010reaction layer at the interface within two hours of contact. This electron\u2010conducting but ion\u2010blocking layer causes non\u2010uniform Na electrodeposition, triggering continuous mechanical cracking inward Na3PS4 that leads to a short\u2010circuit. To address this issue, a thermodynamically stable thin Na3Sb\u2010NaF functional layer is engineered on Na to protect Na3PS4 from being chemically reduced. Its high Na\u2010ion diffusivity ensures uniform ion transport for homogeneous Na electrodeposition, enabling a mechanically integrated interface. As a result, symmetric cells sustain over 1000 h of cycling at 0.1\u00a0mA cm\u20132 (0.1 mAh cm\u22122), while full cells using NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes achieve 88.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 C, room temperature. Crucially, anode\u2010free all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries exhibit stable cycling for over 60 cycles. This work advances the development of high\u2010energy, durable all\u2010solid\u2010state sodium metal batteries.",

This O2 activation enhances Spiro\u2010OMeTAD conductivity, optimizes energy\u2010level alignment with carbon electrodes, and suppresses interfacial charge\u2010transfer losses. As a result, C\u2010PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 23.85%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe 2,2\u2019,7,7\u2019\u2010tetrakis[N, N\u2010di(4\u2010methoxyphenyl)amino]\u20109,9\u2019\u2010spirobifluorene (Spiro\u2010OMeTAD), a widely used hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), heavily relies on p\u2010doping for improving its electrical properties, which is typically achieved through ambient O2 oxidation. Nevertheless, as a result of the inherent inertness of O2 toward Spiro\u2010OMeTAD oxidation, the doping level of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD remains constrained. In this study, we introduce an effective approach to enhance the doping level of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD employing the single Ti atoms on carbon nanohorns (CNH) as a molecular platform to activate O2, in turn facilitating the oxidation of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD. The charge transfer between the Ti1\u2010O5 moieties and CNH, resulting from strong metal\u2010support interaction (SMSI), enhances O2 chemisorption, weakens the O\u2500O bond, and promotes O2 dissociation, thereby effectively activating O2 molecules for the oxidation of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD. Such sufficient oxidation effectively boosts the doping level of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD, consequently improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the work function of Spiro\u2010OMeTAD is also well\u2010modulated, aligning its energy levels more effectively with the carbon electrode. This strategy significantly minimizes energy loss in charge transfer, allowing carbon\u2010based PSCs to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.85% (certified at 22.85%). Remarkably, the device retains 96.2% of its initial value after 1000 h of continuous illumination.",

Herein, we introduce n\u2010type conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as electron transport layers to address these challenges. Two CPEs based on a naphthalene diimide backbone with distinct ionic substituents were investigated: a zwitterionic sulfobetaine (PNDI\u2010Z3) and a quaternary ammonium iodide (PNDI\u2010NI). Both CPEs significantly enhance surface wettability and promote uniform Pt nanoparticle deposition compared to photocathodes without CPEs. Notably, PNDI\u2010NI enables iodide\u2013chloride exchange with platinate precursors, accelerating the photoreduction of PtIV to PtII and ensuring strong immobilization of Pt species. Further reduction to metallic Pt0 occurs during PEC operation under applied reduction potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the pivotal role of iodide in facilitating this reduction pathway. The resulting PNDI\u2010NI\u2010modified photocathode achieves a photocurrent density of 17.7\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and an applied bias photon\u2010to\u2010current efficiency of 8.88%, representing the highest performance among reported organic photocathodes, alongside superior operational stability confirmed by chronoamperometry.

Here, this challenge is overcome through a universal defect engineering strategy centered on metal oxide nanoparticles. By creating a high density of oxygen vacancies in zirconia (ZrO2), we transform the nanoparticles into potent Lewis acid sites. This dual functionality engineers the polymer\u2010filler interface to create continuous, low\u2010resistance pathways for rapid OH\u2212 transport, while simultaneously establishing strong Lewis acid\u2010base \u201cmolecular anchoring\u201d to the polymer matrix and support mesh.

    "link": "https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202505848?af=R",
    "content": "This work develops an atomic\u2010level N refilling oxygen vacancy strategy to inhibit the vanadium dissolution in V6O13\u2010based cathode material based on the principle of Gibbs free energy regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nVanadium oxides have been considered as ideal cathode materials for aqueous zinc\u2010ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their multivalent characteristics and open framework. Nevertheless, spontaneous vanadium dissolution and inherent low electronic conductivity of vanadium oxides result in severe capacity degradation during prolonged cycling. Herein, we propose a strategy of atomic\u2010level N refilling oxygen vacancy (Vo) to thermodynamically enhance the intrinsic structural strength of the V6O13 cathode (V6O13\u2010Vo\u2010N) through regulation of Gibbs free energy (\u0394G = \u0394H \u2212 T\u0394S). Theoretical calculations indicate that refilled N atoms strengthen V\u2500O bonds by improving orbital hybridization between V 3d and O 2p and reduce the lattice formation energy, endowing V6O13\u2010Vo\u2010N with enhanced intrinsic structural strength, which contributes to an increased enthalpy change (\u0394H). Moreover, N refilling can maintain structural integrity and stabilize oxygen vacancies during dynamic cycling, ultimately leading to a reduced entropy change (\u0394S). Consequently, the directional regulation of \u0394H and \u0394S leads to an elevated \u0394G value, establishing a thermodynamic barrier to inhibit spontaneous vanadium dissolution.

This review aims to comprehensively and profoundly analyze the performance degradation mechanism of PFSAs, summarize the corresponding mitigation strategies, and further facilitate the research and development of high\u2010performance PFSA materials suitable for moderate\u2010temperature applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nProton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) demonstrate significant advantages when operating at moderate temperatures (>100\u00b0C), including optimized kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction, simplified water\u2010heat management system, and enhanced resistance to CO poisoning. Given these advantages, PEMFCs demonstrate excellent applicability in heavy\u2010duty vehicles and are expected to significantly advance the commercialization of this technology. Ionomers, which serve as electrolytes, binders, and dispersants for the catalyst layer (CL), play a crucial role in PEMFCs. However, commercially available perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers (PFSAs) suffer from core issues such as decreased proton conductivity, increased oxygen transmission resistance, and accelerated chemical degradation at moderate temperature. Currently, significant research efforts have been invested in this field, leading to the development of numerous innovative material systems. However, the preparation of moderate temperature PFSAs remains an extremely challenging task. A comprehensive and in\u2010depth analysis of the performance failure mechanisms of PFSAs in CL and a summary of relevant mitigation measures are of critical importance for understanding and addressing these issues. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the challenges faced by PFSAs at moderate temperatures and their underlying mechanisms, introduces relevant optimization strategies, and finally proposes constructive insights into the existing challenges and future development directions for moderate temperature PFSAs.",

Finally, the techno\u2010economic aspects of converting captured CO2 into valuable products are evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nElectrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion (ECC) offers a promising route to reduce CO2 emissions and to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical fuels. To date, ECC has been mainly based on pure CO2 gas isolated from carbon capture solutions, which is an energy\u2010intensive step. Recently, direct CO2 conversion from a capture solution, which enables integrated CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion, has attracted attention because it can eliminate the energy\u2010intensive CO2 isolation step. In addition, producing concentrated gas products in integrated systems reduces the cost for downstream separation. This review discusses the key aspects of integrated CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion systems, including direct air capture (DAC), the chemistry of CO2 capture and release, electrode designs and system configurations, as well as technoeconomic viability.

In addition, the local electric field enhancement and the optimized in\u2010plane/out\u2010of\u2010plane capillary forces derived from the nanocone structure significantly facilitated CO2 desorption and reaction kinetics. Accordingly, the optimal Ni0.9Co0.1\u2010NC electrode exhibited an ultralow onset potential of 1.30\u00a0V versus RHE and a high current density of 332\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 at 1.40\u00a0V versus RHE, surmounting Ni\u2010NC and Co\u2010NC by 5.5 and 17 times, respectively.

By combining titration gas chromatography with systematic electrolyte comparisons, this study uncovers the interplay between SEI evolution and dead lithium recovery, revealing the reversible and dynamic nature of rest\u2010induced degradation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nCalendar aging significantly affects lithium metal battery performance, with even short rest periods causing measurable drops in Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, most studies focus only on CE losses during rest, and the impact on subsequent cycles remains unclear. Here, calendar aging behavior is systematically examined in various carbonate and ether electrolytes, showing that aging influences not only CE after rest but also the following cycles. While all electrolytes show CE loss during rest, distinct CE patterns appear in the two post\u2010rest cycles. To clarify the mechanism behind these fluctuations, dead lithium formation during and after aging is tracked using titration gas chromatography. This also enables quantification of CE loss associated with solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) evolution. The results indicate that the interplay between SEI evolution and dead lithium recovery governs the electrolyte\u2010dependent CE response during post\u2010rest cycling. Resting frequency in full cells is further varied, and it is found that increased resting frequency does not necessarily accelerate capacity loss, suggesting that rest\u2010induced degradation is largely reversible.

This dual\u2010layer regulation considerably increases the interlayer spacing ratio (dO\u2010Na\u2010O/dO\u2010TM\u2010O), which not only promotes a more moderate and reversible structural evolution but also improves Na+ diffusion kinetics during cycling. Therefore, the engineered cathode exhibits enhanced specific capacity and cycling stability in both half and full cells. This work offers a scalable strategy toward the development of high\u2010performance SIBs for practical applications.",

However, the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts remains challenging due to the incompatible reaction mechanisms of the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we design a hollow MoS2 nanoreactor decorated with Ni nanoparticles (Nix@MoS2) featuring strong metal\u2010support interaction (SMSI). The SMSI\u2010induced interfacial electron redistribution creates nucleophilic S sites and electrophilic Ni sites, which synergistically lower H* adsorption energy barrier in HER and favor the N\u2500N bond breakage in HzOR. The optimized Ni2@MoS2 nanoreactor demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, achieving a current density of 100\u00a0mA cm\u20132 at only 0.193\u00a0V in hybrid HzOR\u2010assisted water electrolysis, outperforming the most reported bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the electrolyzer exhibits excellent long\u2010term operational stability, maintaining consistent performance over 200\u00a0h at 200\u00a0mA cm\u22122. This work proposes a plausible N\u2500N bond breakage pathway in HzOR enabled by SMSI strategy, offering new insights into the water electrolysis for green hydrogen production.",

    "content": "CaCd2P2, a visible\u2010light absorber identified by computational screening, undergoes a light\u2010stabilized surface transformation that enables stable alkaline OER. Photoelectrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic analysis show synergistic CoPi co\u2010catalysis and contrast this behavior with typical photocorrosion, highlighting AM2P2 phosphides as promising low\u2010bandgap photoelectrodes with tunable interfacial chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nA key bottleneck to solar fuels is the absence of stable and strongly absorbing photoelectrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Modern approaches generally trade off between stable but weakly absorbing materials, such as wide bandgap oxides, or strongly absorbing materials that rely on encapsulation for stability and are weakly catalytic, such as the III\u2010V family of semiconductors. Of interest are materials like transition metal phosphides, such as FeP2, that are known to undergo beneficial in situ surface transformations in the oxidative environment of OER, though stability has remained a primary hurdle. Here, we report on CaCd2P2, a Zintl phase visible\u2010light absorber with favorable 1.6 eV bandgap, that we identified using high\u2010throughput computational screening. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical measurements, microscopy, and spectroscopy, we show that CaCd2P2 undergoes a light\u2010stabilized surface transformation that renders it stable under alkaline OER conditions. We also show that the well known OER catalyst CoPi can act as a stable co\u2010catalyst in synergy with the modified in situ CaCd2P2 surface. The light\u2010induced stabilizing transformation that CaCd2P2 undergoes is in sharp contrast to the photocorrosion commonly observed in visible light\u2010absorbing photoelectrodes. The broader AM2P2 family of Zintl phases offers a significant opportunity to explore stabilizing interface chemistry and re\u2010design the manner in which low\u2010bandgap semiconductors are used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.",

However, sulfide SSEs still react with Si/C above 350\u00b0C, producing Li2S, P2Sx, and POx. In full\u2010cells, thermal failure of sulfide\u2010based all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries begins at the cathode side, while the anode reactions above 350\u00b0C intensify failure. This work identifies key failure mechanisms to guide safer all\u2010solid\u2010state battery design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSulfide\u2010based all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs) with high\u2010capacity cathodes/anodes are currently the most promising candidates among next\u2010generation power batteries. However, the intrinsic risk of thermal runaway remains a significant safety concern for ASSBs, urging a thorough exploration of their thermal failure mechanisms. Notably, the thermal stability and underlying failure mechanisms between the Si\u2010based anode and sulfide solid\u2010state electrolytes (SSEs) remain unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate the exothermic behavior of four representative sulfide SSEs with a Si/C anode. Although the sulfide SSEs exhibit superior thermal stability towards Si/C anode compared to liquid electrolytes, with few significant exothermic reactions below 350\u00b0C, they do undergo intense exothermic reactions at higher temperatures. In\u2010depth characterizations identify Li2S, P2Sx, and POx species as the key reaction products, along with a significant amount of heat generation. Furthermore, by integrating reaction mechanisms from both composite anode and cathode, we propose a three\u2010stage thermal failure mechanism of LiNixCoyMnzO2 | sulfide SSE | Si/C ASSB. The thermal failure of ASSB is initiated by the release of oxygen from the cathode, followed by solid\u2013solid reactions between the cathode and sulfide SSEs. The final stage involves the Si/C anode, which participates in a complex chain of exothermic reactions, culminating in catastrophic thermal failure of ASSB.",

XRD, SEM, TXM, and XANES together reveal how synthesis stoichiometry governs structure and durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe stability of O3\u2010type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2${\\rm NaNi}_{1/3} {\\rm Fe}_{1/3} {\\rm Mn}_{1/3} {\\rm O}_2$ under high\u2010voltage cycling is dictated by how synthesis encodes lattice strain and redox heterogeneity. Here, the role of Na:TM stoichiometry is systematically resolved by tuning the NaOH:precursor ratio during solid\u2010state synthesis. The stoichiometric condition (Na:TM = 1.00) yields minimized microstrain, enabling uniform O3\u2013P3 phase evolution and homogeneous multi\u2010metal redox with preserved octahedral symmetry. In contrast, Na\u2010excess compositions inherit disordered intermediates and heterogeneous distortion fields that trigger abrupt multiphase transitions and promote localized charge redistribution. In situ XRD captures the divergence in phase\u2010transition pathways, TXM resolves particle\u2010level redox heterogeneity, and XANES corroborates a stronger and more reversible Fe redox contribution at stoichiometry, shifting to diminished Fe participation and spatially inhomogeneous redox at higher Na content. These results establish Na:TM stoichiometry as a critical synthesis parameter controlling both structural coherence and redox stability. Electrochemically, the stoichiometric composition exhibits smooth voltage profiles with minimal polarization growth and retains nearly 80% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles even at an extended 4.2\u00a0V cutoff, whereas Na\u2010excess compositions show significantly reduced initial coulombic efficiency and rapid voltage fade.

However, the practical use of lithium metal anodes in ASSBs remains limited by interfacial instability and dendritic Li growth, particularly under moderate stack pressures. Here, we report a nano\u2010sized tin (nSn) interlayer that forms a highly reversible Li\u2013Sn alloy interface via spontaneous in situ lithiation, offering a robust, lithiophilic, and electronically conductive interface between the Li metal and sulfide\u2010based solid electrolyte. The resulting LixSn layer promotes uniform Li\u2010ion transport, suppresses dendrite formation, and enhances interfacial charge transfer. Symmetric cell measurements demonstrate markedly improved critical current densities and stable cycling, while full\u2010cell tests reveal high Coulombic efficiency, improved rate performance, and excellent capacity retention. The nSn interlayer was further scaled into a sheet\u2010type architecture using a warm isostatic press (WIP) process for integration into pouch\u2010type cells. The pouch cell exhibited high areal capacity, retaining 81% after 500 cycles, and delivered energy densities of 351\u00a0Wh kg\u22121 and 918\u00a0Wh L\u22121 under a low external pressure of 2\u00a0MPa.

In particular, the low volatility, high ionic conductivity, and large chemical and electrochemical stability of some ionic liquid chemistries have been key in the development of high\u2010performance electrolytes for electrochemical devices including sodium batteries. Recently, exploration has turned to modifications in the ionic liquid cation chemistry, as well as the sodium salt concentration, demonstrating significant influence on the anode cycling performance (both metal sodium and hard carbon), while the initial cycling protocols also have a marked effect on cycling stability. While the beneficial properties of ILs in energy storage applications have been well demonstrated, there is still a great deal to learn about their interactions both in the bulk and at electrode interfaces to facilitate further improvements in their chemical design. Future work to advance next\u2010generation sodium battery technologies should focus on the design and synthesis of new IL cations and anions with structural features promoting high sodium ion transport through improved coordination structures, as well as improved understanding of the interface interactions that contribute to improved solid electrolyte interphases solid\u2013electrolyte interphase and uniform sodium plating.",

    "content": "In this study, with the AEI machine learning descriptor as the core driving force, the sulfur\u2010doped asymmetric dinuclear cobalt catalyst (Co2/NSC) was efficiently screened out, successfully overcoming core bottlenecks such as low selectivity and slow kinetics in the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) process. This catalyst not only exhibits a near\u2010100% ammonia Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability but also proves its industrial application potential through techno\u2010economic analysis. This research forms a complete logical chain of \u201cdata\u2010driven \u2010 catalytic breakthrough \u2010 industrial adaptation\u201d and provides key support for the development of nitrate reduction to ammonia technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a promising way to reduce pollutants and synthesis ammonia. However, it is fraught with problems such as unbalanced adsorption\u2013desorption of intermediates, insufficient H* supply, and competing hydrogen evolution. Dual\u2010atom catalysts (DACs) have emerged as promising candidates, but their rational design faces obstacles in balancing element selection and performance. To address this, we employed high\u2010throughput calculations and machine learning to screen a series of DACs for NO3RR. Am+${\\mathrm{A}}_{\\mathrm{m}}^ + $, dm1\u2010dm2 and Qm+${\\mathrm{Q}}_{\\mathrm{m}}^ + $ were identified as key features. Based on interpretable SHAP analysis, we predicted and developed a sulphur\u2010doped, asymmetric, dinuclear cobalt catalyst (Co2/NSC). Experiments show that this catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 99.95% for NH3 production at \u22120.2\u00a0V vs. RHE, with a maximum yield of 101.19\u00a0mg h\u22121 mgcat\u22121 at \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. RHE. The underlying mechanism and DFT calculations indicate that dinuclear Co sites enhance *NO3\u2212 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate\u2010determining step *NO\u2192*NHO; sulphur doping facilitates active *H supply and stabilizes the *NHO intermediate via an S\u2500H/O\u2500H hydrogen bonding network, suppressing side reactions. In addition, the integrated membrane electrode assembly system and the technical\u2010economic analysis confirm the practical applicability and economic viability of this process.",

Meanwhile, inhibiting the formation of iodine related species is crucial for mitigating inorganic perovskite decomposition. Here, we introduce 4\u2010chlorobenzenesulfinic acid (CBSA), a Lewis base with strong coordination ability, into the inorganic perovskite precursor solution to modulate Pb2+ chemistry environment and implement iodine management. The robust interaction between CBSA and [PbI6]4\u2212 octahedra promotes the ion exchange process dominated by DMAI volatilization and cesium ion intercalation, inducing uniform nucleation and the formation of large grains size. Moreover, CBSA locks iodide ions through hydrogen bonding to reduce the formation of iodine defects and iodine species, while reducing trap density and alleviating perovskite decomposition by passivating undercoordinated lead defects. Ultimately, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) with CBSA is increased from 18.88% to 21.67%. More importantly, unencapsulated devices maintained 95% of their initial efficiency after 550\u00a0h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous 1\u2010sun illumination, demonstrating exceptional operational stability.",

    "content": "This study introduces a multidimensional framework integrating electrical performance, cost, and life cycle assessment for 140 real and virtual battery cells. Results show that LFP offers low emissions and costs, sodium\u2010ion excels in resource efficiency, and pouch housings and higher energy densities effectively reduce environmental burdens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe mounting demand for battery cells in the context of the energy transition necessitates evaluation methodologies that extend beyond mere performance metrics. This work presents a multidimensional framework that simultaneously integrates electrical performance, economic costs, and life cycle assessment into a consistent analysis of real and virtual cells. In total 140 cells were modeled, covering commercial chemistries and systematically permuted configurations. The framework enables systematic comparisons of real commercial cells and virtual redesigns by varying cell parameters under consistent boundary conditions without unintended side effects. Ultra high energy cells were generated, achieving very high energy densities under idealized design assumptions. Lithium\u2010iron\u2010phosphate (LFP) battery cells exhibit global warming potential values of 53\u221263kgCO2-EqkWh$53-63\\, \\textit{kg}\\, C{O}_{2}\\text{-Eq}\\text{kWh}$, while sodium\u2010ion batteries (SiB) show a slightly higher range of 59\u221272kgCO2-EqkWh$59-72\\, \\textit{kg}\\, C{O}_{2}\\text{-Eq}\\text{kWh}$.

SiB cells achieve mineral resource scarcity values of about 5kgCu-EqkWh$5\\, \\textit{kg}\\, \\textit{Cu}\\text{-Eq}\\text{kWh}$, three times lower than lithium\u2010ion batteries. Cathode chemistry proves decisive for ecological performance, with nickel sulfate\u2010based precursors showing the highest acidification values and LFP cells showing the lowest. Housing design plays an important role: pouch formats minimize costs and emissions. Systematic permutations show that increasing energy density is a key lever to lower environmental\u00a0burdens.",
