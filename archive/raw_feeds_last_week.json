The lower interfacial migration energy barrier and adsorption energy can facilitate Zn2+ rapid deposition, accelerate the deposition kinetics, and thereby effectively inhibit the dendrites formation. This Zn2+ highway regulator ensures the excellent cycling stability and deep reversibility performance of AZMBs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe issue of zinc dendrites and chaotic Zn2+ deposition at electrode/electrolyte interface significantly hindered commercialization of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Therefore, we propose a Zn2+ highway regulator strategy by introducing nano\u2010zirconium silicate interphase (ZSP) to address the above issues. ZSP with low Zn2+ migration energy barrier of ZrSiO4 can facilitate Zn2+ transport efficiency and inhibit dendrite growth, thereby achieving highly reversible zinc metal anode. The featured ZSP@Zn//ZSP@Zn symmetric cell demonstrates an ultra\u2010long cycle life exceeding 4700 h at 0.25 mA cm\u22122 (0.25 mAh cm\u22122). Even under a deep depth of discharge \u224885.4%, it still maintains stable operation for over 400 h. Furthermore, the advanced NH4V4O10//ZSP@Zn full cell, featuring a high mass loading of 15.25 mg cm\u22122 (N/P = 2.1), exhibited stable performance over 520 cycles (1 A g\u22121), retaining 80.48% of initial capacity (187.32 mAh g\u22121).

One of the key restrictions for the practical implementation of EC is how to maximize and control the bidirectional positive and negative electrocaloric effects (PEC and NEC) within a single low\u2010power EC film. In this study, the remarkable temperature changes of \u0394T = 30.2\u00a0K for PEC and \u0394T = \u221210.2\u00a0K for NEC are achieved via calculation in (111)\u2010oriented Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)0.5Zr0.15Ti0.35O3 (PNN\u2010PT\u2010PZ) relaxor thin films, exceedingly almost all representative EC cooling options. Such giant bidirectional electrocaloric effects are ascribed to the different symmetry conforming behavior of defect dipoles at distinct thermal activation states. At room temperature, the interfacial stress and large driving electric field intensified the symmetry conforming between defect dipoles and intrinsic polarization, which facilitated positive coupling for PEC. In comparison, the high temperature not only enables the tetragonal\u2192rhombohedral transitions with positive pyroelectric constants, but also disrupts the intrinsic polarization and symmetry conforming state of defect dipoles, both leading to a polar disorder state under applying electric fields and the appearance of large NEC amplitude.

However, their operation at high temperatures faces fundamental challenges: rising conduction losses and premature breakdown under extreme coupled thermal\u2010electric fields lead to deteriorated energy storage properties. In this study, the trade\u2010off between dielectric performance and high operating temperature is effectively addressed by strategically integrating metalla\u2010aromatic complexes (MACs) into the polycarbonate (PC) matrix.

In this perspective, we critically analyze the progress made by the community on several scientific questions. We first examine how SAMs are chemically bonded to TCOs, which is complicated by the difficulty in characterizing SAMs coverage on rough TCO substrates. We question the general perception of how charges are collected through SAMs layer to TCOs. And finally, the stability issues related to SAMs are discussed.

The degree of polymerization could be monitored via in situ scanning Raman spectroscopy. The reaction pathways are revealed via both experiments and theoretical calculations. It is interesting to find that, without adding any extra conventional initiators, the dehydrogenation reaction of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) molecules at high voltages could initiate the polymerization of 1,3\u2010dioxolane (DOL). The LiFePO4||Li cells utilizing ELPO demonstrate an extraordinary capacity retention of 88.86% after 740 cycles and largely enhance the safety compared to their regular counterparts.

NiSA exhibits outstanding CO2 activation ability but limited CH4 dissociation activity. NiNP is highly active for CH4 dissociation but prone to oxidation and carbon deposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nOxygen\u2010involved dry reforming of methane (ODRM) shows potential for converting impure CO2 captured from air, but it suffers from low CO2 conversion, especially at low temperatures (400\u00b0C\u2013700\u00b0C). The optimization of catalysts via controlling the size of metal centers is significant for this reaction. Herein, we report for the first time the roles of Ni single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on dendritic mesoporous silica (DMS) in determining the catalytic activity for low\u2010temperature ODRM with different CH4/CO2/O2 ratios. Both the single\u2010atoms (NiSA/DMS) and nanoparticles (NiNP/DMS) on DMS are highly efficient in catalyzing the reforming of CO2 and CH4, with the conversions of CO2 and CH4 in the range of 56%\u201361% at 550\u00b0C. The presence of O2 suppresses the CO2 conversion, while the NiSA/DMS catalyst shows higher O2\u2010tolerance than the NiNP/DMS, especially for the reactants with a relatively high concentration of O2. In addition, the Ni NPs tend to be oxidized by O2 and favor the carbon formation, which hinders the catalytic performance during long\u2010term running. The Ni SAs stabilized by the interaction with DMS are highly stable under aerobic conditions and inhibit the formation of carbon deposits from CH4 dissociation. The in situ characterizations and DFT calculations reveal that the Ni SAs show higher capacity for CO2 dissociation but weaker ability to activate the C\u2010H bond of CH4 than NPs, which contributes to the superior O2\u2010tolerance and carbon resistant of the NiSA/DMS catalyst.

This cathode/electrolyte system breaks away from the conventional degradation mechanisms reported in Ni\u2010rich cathodes. The developed cathode exhibited an excellent cycle life (10\u00a0000 cycles) and suppressed gas evolution even when its particles are extensively cracked, with its performance validated under practically relevant conditions, including a high electrode density (3.2\u00a0g\u00a0cm\u22123) and capacity (700\u00a0mAh). In contrast to a conventional Ni\u2010rich cathode that experiences exacerbated thermal safety issues when cycled, the configuration reported herein maintained its thermal stability even after long\u2010term cycles. Collectively, the developed Ni\u2010rich\u2010cathode/electrolyte system transcends the traditional limitations of Ni\u2010rich cathodes and provides opportunities for redefining the practical limits of high\u2010energy, long\u2010life, and safe batteries.",

However, its roll\u2010to\u2010roll scalability remains limited by competing demands among process efficiency, mechanical integrity, and electrochemical performance, particularly under reduced binder content. Here, we address these challenges by investigating the fibrillation behavior of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binders depending on carbon additive type. Among the tested architectures, carbon nanotube (CNT) coating significantly improves key commercial metrics\u2014reducing kneading time by over 75%, enhancing mechanical strength, and achieving superior electrochemical performance\u2014while also offering compatibility with roll\u2010to\u2010roll manufacturing.

While cathode engineering has been extensively explored to mitigate these challenges, electrolyte\u2010based strategies for directly regulating oxygen redox remain limited. To address this limitation, an anthracene\u2010functionalized cyanoethyl polyvinyl alcohol (An\u2010PVA\u2010CN) gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is developed, offering dual functionalities: anchoring oxidized surface oxygen and scavenging singlet oxygen. The anthracene moiety binds to oxidized lattice oxygen prior to O\u2013O dimer formation, forming a stable Ni\u2500O\u2500C bridging structure that suppresses singlet oxygen release. It also acts as an effective scavenger for any singlet oxygen generated. Simultaneously, the electron\u2010rich nitrile groups coordinate with transition metals, suppressing over\u2010oxidation of Ni during charging. Spectroscopic and computational analyses confirm the suppression of oxygen redox and stabilization of surface oxygen species. By regulating charge compensation via transition metal redox while inhibiting oxygen redox, oxygen gas evolution and transition metal dissolution are effectively mitigated.

Utilizing this computational framework, accompanied by illustrative synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr0.75Fe0.25O2, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 and 320 mAhg\u22121 in its 20% Li\u2010excess variant Li1.2Cr0.6Fe0.2O2, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first\u2010principles studies of ordering tendencies.",

In situ temperature\u2010dependent X \u2010 ray diffraction confirms that LRE stabilizes the lithiated anode phase up to 184\u00a0\u00b0C, a 51\u00a0\u00b0C improvement over conventional electrolytes, thereby retarding exothermic electrolyte reduction. Notably, a subsequent 27.3% decrease in reductive gases mitigates crosstalk\u2010induced cathode degradation while reducing combustion risks in pouch cells when employing LRE. Practical evaluation in 2.4 Ah NCM955|SiC pouch cells reveals that LRE sustains exceptional stability up to 255.0\u00a0\u00b0C under heating, significantly outperforming conventional cells that failed at 165.6\u00a0\u00b0C with violent combustion. Furthermore, the 2.4Ah pouch cell maintains an impressive 84.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles, indicating enhanced electrochemical stability and longevity. This work highlights the potential of coordination chemistry in developing safe and durable energy\u2010dense batteries.",

This outcome finally optimizes the atomic structure by passivating the deep\u2010level defects such as Se and S vacancy, while also increasing the crystallinity through a strong chemical bonding effect. Furthermore, the slight etching of the surface by ammonia reduces the content of antimony oxide, increases phase purity, and optimizes interfacial contact in the device, thereby facilitating carrier transport.

This tutorial and research perspective demonstrates the opportunity for rapid optimization of processing conditions and surface treatments, in the manufacturing of emerging metal halide perovskite active layers, coupled with enhancements in durability through the understanding of electrochemical mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nControl over charge injection and extraction processes across buried interfaces is fundamental for all (opto)electronic multilayer device platforms, necessitating detailed understanding of local structural and chemical differences that promote defect formation, distort energetic band\u2010edge alignments, and alter charge transport processes. Herein, the implementation of a low\u2010cost electroanalytical methodologies\u2019 tool suite is described to quantitatively characterize buried interfaces and redox reactions in printable, mixed electrical\u2013ionic, and redox\u2010active metal halide perovskites and a prototypical hole\u2010transporting nickel oxide (NiOx) thin film. The objective is to demonstrate the power of electrochemical methodologies to improve the nanoscale understanding of complex interfaces within optoelectronic devices by providing case studies on how to: i) differentiate between electronic and chemical properties in NiOx contacts; ii) measure changes in reversibility of halide redox reactions via NiOx surface states; iii) assess energy alignment and charge transport across (modified) buried interfaces; and iv) quantify defects at buried interfaces that change with modifiers and differences in perovskite processing, including increasing defect concentrations when films are slot\u2010die\u2010coated versus spin\u2010cast. The collective approach addresses major challenges in understanding the precise energy landscape and interface reactivity under relevant electric fields that mimic operando conditions (away from equilibrium) and across length scales in thin film device formats.",

However, carbonate\u2010based electrolytes, which are essential for high\u2010voltage operation, induce severe parasitic reactions at the Li metal anode, generating HF and gaseous byproducts that destabilize the interface and accelerate cell failure. To address this problem, we propose a multifunctional separator (APA\u2010g\u2010APT) that incorporates uniformly distributed Si\u2500OR moieties capable of chemically scavenging HF, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions and promoting the formation of stable, inorganic\u2010rich interphases on both Li anodes and NCM811 cathodes.

A central factor is the carbon\u2010binder domain (CBD), which plays a dual role in electrode. It provides electronic pathways but simultaneously impedes ionic transport. The coexistence of pores between active materials and nanoscale pores within the CBD has previously been recognized, but their individual contributions have not been quantitatively resolved.

DTLM provides a physically grounded and domain\u2010resolved interpretation of porosity\u2013tortuosity behavior, offering additional insight beyond what can be obtained from conventional Bruggeman relations or transmission line models. Guided by this framework, we design an optimized electrode formulation with 2 wt.% carbon black (CB), moderate milling, and a reduced binder\u2010to\u2010CB ratio.

Precise tuning of water activity enables fast ion transport and stabilization of four\u2010electron redox pathways, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions and delivering high\u2010capacity, durable aqueous Zn\u2010I2 batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWater governs both reactivity and transport in aqueous batteries, yet the occurrence of distinct free, coordinated, and network\u2010bound states complicates electrolyte design. Here, a quantitative water\u2010speciation identification (QWSI) strategy is established to resolve and quantify water populations and to correlate composition with microstructure and function. Aqueous Zn\u2010I2 batteries are employed as a model system owing to the high sensitivity of capacity to water\u2010state distributions. Eliminating free water stabilizes electrophilic iodine species and activates the I2/2I+ couple to realize a four\u2010electron conversion that doubles capacity, whereas driving water content too low depletes coordinated and network\u2010bound water, slows ion transport, and ultimately compromises capacity. The QWSI strategy pinpoints a critical composition at which water resides within hydrogen\u2010bond networks and cation solvation shells, with no detectable bulk\u2010like free water. Electrolytes formulated at this composition sustain four\u2010electron conversion while maintaining high ionic conductivity, reconciling activation of four\u2010electron conversion with ion transport. Consequently, the Zn//I2 cells deliver distinct two\u2010plateau profiles and high reversibility, enabling an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and a specific capacity of 309.1 mAh\u00b7g\u22121.

A series of Ni\u2010doped ZnIn2S4 catalysts with varying doping concentrations is hydrothermally synthesized. Structural characterizations confirm substitutional incorporation of Ni at Zn lattice sites, accompanied by vacancy formation, whereas the surface layers of self\u2010assembled nanosheets remain Ni\u2010free. Under intensified fluid\u2010induced shear stress, the ZnIn2S4\u2010based catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced piezophotocatalytic performance for both hydrogen production and glucose valorization. An optimal Ni doping level is identified that maximizes piezoelectric polarization, delivering a fivefold increase in the yields of H2, arabinose, and formic acid compared to pristine ZnIn2S4, thereby highlighting the critical role of Ni doping in amplifying piezoelectric effects. Multiscale simulations reveal that Ni incorporation in ZnIn2S4 primarily modulates vacancy concentrations and bulk electronic properties, including dielectric response, elastic modulus, and piezoelectric potential, to boost charge separation efficiency.

In LIBs, LiNixMnyCozO2(NMC) cathodes are one of the major cathode materials. Thus, recycling NMC cathodes from spent lithium\u2010ion batteries is emerging because they contain abundant valuable materials, which can be considered unique \u201cmineral\u201d sources. Impurities are one of the main concerns for introducing recovered materials back into new battery manufacture because impurities are typically considered to impair the properties of recovered materials. However, some impurities can beneficially act as dopants or coatings. To comprehensively understand the effects of different impurities and treat impurities properly, this review summarizes the origin and species of possible impurities which can be introduced during different pretreatment processes, analyzes the methods to remove impurities, and discusses the effects of impurities on the regeneration process and recovered materials. This work also outlines future perspectives for fundamental research about impurities and relevant challenges of the recycling industry, helps academia and manufacturers to create new impurity standards of recovered cathode materials, and suggests opportunities for achieving a circular economy for the lithium\u2010ion batteries industry.",

The spatial heterogeneity of each property throughout the cell is also quantified. While the degraded material demonstrated similar capacity as the pristine, its impedance and rate capability are severely diminished. Furthermore, samples from the periphery of the electrode layers showed more severe performance loss compared to samples extracted from central regions. The dominant culprit of performance loss is the material microstructure, where the magnitude of particle cracking showed the strongest correlation to the impedance components that are most unfavorably impacted.

To address this challenge, a rapid precipitation process is developed to boost energy density by converting low Ni\u2010compositions, LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 (NMC111), into higher Ni\u2010compositions (NMC622). This process forms a Ni\u2010rich coating on cathode particles that diffuses into the core upon high\u2010temperature relithiation, increasing compositional homogeneity. The upcycling process leverages existing infrastructure, offering low capital cost and minimal additional chemical input. Through ex situ tomographic transmission X\u2010ray microscopy (TXM), 3D Ni:Co elemental mixing is quantified, confirming that elemental content evens at the secondary particle level with a mean NMC622 composition upon relithiation. However, elemental gradients remain in the single crystalline primary particles. Ex situ high\u2010resolution and in situ wide\u2010angle X\u2010ray diffraction reveals concurrent structural changes during the relithiation process. These findings provide key insights into the structural and chemical mechanisms of elemental diffusion to obtain further improvements of increased capacity and retention through compositional conversion of cathode materials.",

Redox mediator relithiation is shown to be a rapid, efficient method that can be applied to cycled NMC with inherent surface impurities with the proper pre\u2010processing steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nRecycling end\u2010of\u2010life (EOL) lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) is important to retain valuable resources from critical materials present in EOL battery waste. Direct recycling methods offer an opportunity to recover intact valuable cathode materials with minimal re\u2010processing. An important step of the direct recycling process is relithiation which is used to restore lithium content to EOL cathode materials. However, little has been done to study how preprocessing steps such as washing or binder removal may affect relithiation methods in the direct recycling process. Here, the evolution of fluorine byproducts left over from preprocessing steps during a low\u2010temperature chemical redox mediator relithiation process is tracked. A facile washing step is presented as a solution for mediating adverse effects of surface contamination on the chemical relithiation performance. The structure, lithium content, and electrochemical performance of relithiated EOL NMC 622 material that underwent a pre\u2010relithiation washing step to remove fluorine byproducts is shown to match that of pristine NMC 622. In this work, it is showed that redox mediator relithiation as a part of a direct recycling process is a promising low energy method that can be applied to EOL material with inherent surface impurities if the proper pre\u2010relithiation processing steps are implemented.",

Among various durability\u2010related failure behaviors, degradation induced by reverse current (RC) has been largely overlooked, despite its growing relevance under fluctuating RE. Herein, we systematically elucidate a multistage degradation pathway of Ni\u2013Ru electrodes (NR) under an accelerated stress test (AST). By combining full\u2010process electrochemical monitoring with morphological and compositional analysis the pathway is summarized as follow: (i) the dense Ru layer is initially oxidated into rough and defective surface with high surface area, under the Ostwald ripening effect; (ii) promoted by the gradual formation of the Ni\u2013Ru co\u2010exposure to the electrolyte, the Ni substrate is subsequently galvanic corroded accompanied by partial Ru redeposition; (iii) through prolonged operation, both Ni and Ru are extensively oxidated and precipitated, eventually resulting in complete Ru depletion and structural collapse of Ni substrate. Based on this mechanistic understanding, we further investigate the effect of RC amplitude on degradation kinetics. Reducing the RC amplitude fraction from 20% to 0%, the initial Ru oxidation is effectively suppressed and following failure is thereby mitigated, with decreasing the degradation rate from 4.756 to 0.257\u00a0mV h\u22121.

The optimized Y6 film morphology has electron and hole mobilities of 15.5 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d710\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and 30.7 \u00b1 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. The best small OSC (0.08 cm2) has a power conversion efficiency of 5.4%, with the efficiency of a 1.3 cm2 OSC being a creditable 3.1%. These results show that the latest generation of non\u2010fullerene acceptors also opens new avenues for the development of simplified large\u2010scale homojunction OSCs that move beyond the bulk heterojunction approach.",

In this study, Cu2O with various lattice strain is prepared via an in situ reconstruction strategy. Notably, Cu2O with 17.6% lattice strain rate (LS17.6%Cu2O) could achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 76.97% during CO2RR to C2H4 under the industrial current density of 800\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency of the cathode cell and full cell get 43.67% and 48.69%, respectively, which are the best values among Cu2O catalysts. In situ attenuated total reflection surface\u2010enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy indicates that the LS17.6%Cu2O catalyst with moderate lattice strain possesses the highest surface coverage of *CO during the CO2RR. Further density functional theory calculations reveal the moderate lattice strain shifts the d\u2010band center of LS17.6%Cu2O from \u22122.28 to \u22122.06\u00a0eV, thereby enhancing the adsorption energy of *CO and reducing the energy barrier for the dimerization of *CO to form the *COCO intermediate.

The resulting anode\u2010less cell achieves 1000 cycles with high\u2010capacity retention owing to the unique chemistry of the solid\u2010electrolyte interphase and chemical stability of the carborane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nFor anode\u2010free sodium batteries to achieve practical consideration, highly reversible chemistries require exceptional \u226599.95% coulombic efficiencies that maintain over prolonged cycling periods. To do so, consumption of this severely limited sodium inventory must be restricted while metal nucleation processes that comprise the in situ formed metal anode are improved. Herein, we describe a fluorine\u2010free carborane electrolyte that satisfies these criteria by emphasizing reductive stability and weakly coordinating anion behavior as design principles. We find this approach promotes the development of a thin, robust SEI chemistry rich in both organic speciation and boron. The electrolyte described herein exhibits ideal metal nucleation behavior on one\u2010micron thin carbonaceous current collector surfaces and achieves a metal deposition/stripping efficiency near parity for 400 cycles. This novel anode chemistry is introduced to anode\u2010free full cell configurations where 87% of the initial discharge capacity is retained after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. Post\u2010test characterization of deep\u2010cycled anode\u2010free cells reveals suppressed capacity fade in these systems is attributed to the chemical stability of the carborane anion.",

Current material challenges are discussed, and potential directions for future research are proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nProton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology for green hydrogen production, but requires a high iridium (Ir) loading of \u22482.0 mg cm\u22122 in the anode catalyst layer (CL), which increases capital costs and hinders the scalability of system deployment. Conventionally, non\u2010supported IrO2 has been used in the form of film CL, but these structures struggle to maintain sufficient performance at lower Ir loadings, making it difficult to reduce Ir content below 0.1 mg cm\u22122. Lower Ir loading leads to higher electrical resistance and localized hot spots, ultimately causing performance losses. Introducing catalyst supports can address these issues by improving catalyst utilization and enabling the development of efficient CL. While previous studies have primarily focused on advanced electrocatalysts, this review highlights the role of catalyst supports in fabricating efficient CL.

The SWNT/CNF hybrid exhibits exceptional CO2 photoreduction performance with selective CH4 production. The enhanced activity originates from enhanced CO2 adsorption, optimized dynamics, and robust interfacial coupling between SWNT and CNF, which establish Ohmic contact to facilitate rapid charge transfer and suppress recombination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe construction of semiconductor heterojunctions presents a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, the weak interfacial interactions between dissimilar materials often hinder effective charge separation, making the establishment of a robust and well\u2010connected interface, a significant challenge. In this study, a novel vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation\u2010driven fragmentation technique is introduced to synthesize graphitic carbon nitride fragments (CNF). These fragments are integrated in situ with single\u2010walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), forming a SWNT/CNF heterojunction with optimized charge carrier dynamics and improves separation efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that CNF thermodynamically favors methane production by converting the *CO hydrogenation step from endothermic (pristine CN) to exothermic, thereby stabilizing the critical *CHO intermediate. The resulting SWNT/CNF heterostructure exhibits a higher specific surface area with abundant exposed active sites. The SWNT network acts as an efficient electron highway, establishing Ohmic contact that prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated carrier and suppresses recombination. Consequently, the SWNT/CNF photocatalyst achieves a methane production rate of 46.0\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121\u2014representing 6.0\u2010fold and 2.5\u2010fold increases over pristine CN and CNF, respectively, along with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.96% for CH4 and exceptional cyclic stability.

The IrCAEN sample exhibits ultrahigh activity for acidic water oxidation. The CAEN method not only provides an efficient route for the preparation of electrocatalytic materials, but also opens up a new way for the development of multiphase materials, which has the potential to reveal unique properties that are not found in traditional nanomaterials, thus advancing the development of electrocatalytic technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAchieving high catalytic activity and stability with as little iridium (Ir) as possible is essential for the widespread deployment of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE).

Here, a method is reported of growing highly dispersed iridium\u2010based nanoparticles with unprecedented mass activity and stability through confined atom escape and nucleation (CAEN). Unlike conventional synthesis methods in which all metal precursors are free to nucleate, CAEN is characterized by a tunable confinement of metal single atoms in the carbon substrate by asymmetric nitrogen, oxygen\u2010coordination, which establishes a thermodynamic and kinetic equilibrium between single\u2010atom dispersion and nucleation, prevents the growth of metastable phases, and delivers highly stable nanoparticles with durable active surfaces.

Atomistic calculations identify all possible halide migration pathways in PIMs, highlighting their distinct conduction behavior relative to LHPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nIon migration and lead toxicity present significant challenges to commercializing lead halide perovskites (LHPs) based solar cells, particularly the presence of lead obstructs their use in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). Recently, antimony\u2010based perovskite\u2010inspired materials (PIMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for IPVs.

The systematic study, comparing ionic conduction in PIMs with the well\u2010studied LHPs, provides broader mechanistic insights into ionic conduction. This comparison highlights the correlation between ionic conduction, anomalous device behavior, and operational stability. The slower ionic conduction in PIMs, resulting from the high formation energy of halide defects, leads to weaker polarization at the interface and, consequently, higher operational stability. The higher non\u2010radiative recombination rate, coupled with lower ionic mobility, leads to a pronounced negative capacitance after a specific applied bias.

In a custom AEM electrolyzer, it delivers a high current density of 2000 mA cm\u22122 at 1.90 V, exhibits a low degradation rate of 0.09 mV h\u22121 at 1000 mA cm\u22122, and withstands 100 h of 60 s start/stop operation (3000 cycles). This work offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the development of green hydrogen by engineering electrodes that combine favorable activity with robust durability, enabling seamless integration with cost\u2010effective, intermittent renewable energy sources.",

    "content": "A bias\u2010free photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is demonstrated using a single Cu2O photocathode and a dark anode to simultaneously generate hydrogen and upgrade plastic waste\u2010derived ethylene glycol into sodium glycolate. The system delivers a photocurrent density of 5.6 mA cm\u22122, surpassing most previous bias\u2010free PEC reports. This integrated strategy couples solar fuel production with waste valorization, offering a simplified and cost\u2010effective route toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has emerged as a highly promising solar\u2010driven technology for sustainable chemical synthesis. However, this photosynthesis\u2010inspired approach is limited by slow oxygen evolution kinetics. Herein, a bias\u2010free, energy\u2010saving PEC system for simultaneous glycolate and hydrogen production is reported. A highly efficient PdAu catalyst on Ni foam is developed for the upgrading of ethylene glycol (EG) derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics, which shows a high performance for electrochemical glycolate production with a low onset potential of 0.25\u00a0V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.6% at 100\u00a0mA cm\u22122. When coupled with a cuprous oxide (Cu2O) photocathode, the constructed solar\u2010driven PEC\u2010HER//EGOR device achieves a photocurrent density of up to 5.6\u00a0mA cm\u22122 at zero applied bias, owing to the lower potential requirement of EG oxidation than oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, it has nearly unity hydrogen FE and 94.8% glycolate FE at 1 h of unbiased operation, showing great potential in continuous and simultaneous hydrogen production and PET\u2010derived EG valorization without any additional bias or expensive chemicals. This work demonstrates a straightforward, energy\u2010efficient, and environmentally benign solar\u2010to\u2010chemical conversion approach for integrating environmental remediation and PEC synthesis.",

    "content": "A multifunctional allyl trimethyl phosphonium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide ionic liquid additive forms a eutectic mixture with EC, facilitates Li+ desolvation, and constructs a thin and uniform LiF\u2010rich solid electrolyte interphase, ensuring stable subzero\u2010temperature performance of lithium\u2010ion full cells under practical conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nCommercial lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) suffer substantial performance degradation at subzero temperatures due to the increased viscosity of ethylene carbonate (EC)\u2010based electrolytes and a high energy barrier for lithium\u2010ion (Li\u207a) desolvation at the graphite anode interface, posing critical challenges for applications in cold climates and extreme environments. To overcome this, a phosphonium\u2010based ionic liquid, allyl trimethyl phosphonium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (APT), is introduced as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. APT forms a eutectic mixture with EC, effectively lowering the freezing point and viscosity while enhancing ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Furthermore, APT weakens the Li\u207a\u2013EC interaction, facilitating more efficient Li\u207a desolvation at the graphite interface, and promotes the formation of a thin, uniform, LiF\u2010rich solid electrolyte interphase on the graphite anode, leading to the fast interfacial Li\u207a transfer kinetics. Pouch cells with high\u2010mass\u2010loading electrodes (NCM811||graphite, 4.9\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm\u22122) and lean electrolyte (3\u00a0g\u00a0Ah\u22121) containing 1 wt.% of APT retained 87.56% of their capacity after 100 cycles at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C, significantly outperforming cells without the additive (64.60% retention). Therefore, this work provides a rational design strategy for multifunctional electrolyte additives that simultaneously optimize bulk transport properties and interfacial stability for reliable LIB operation under subzero conditions.",

The resulting batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 215 mAh g\u22121, excellent rate capability, and long\u2010term cycling stability with 88% capacity retention after 10\u00a0000 cycles. This work offers a scalable framework for designing high\u2010performance, durable metal\u2010halide batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous zinc\u2010iodine batteries (AZIBs) have emerged as promising candidates for sustainable energy storage, benefiting from the earth's abundance and low redox potential of zinc. However, their practical deployment remains constrained by polyiodide shuttling, non\u2010uniform zinc deposition, and hydrogen evolution side reactions issues that collectively undermine capacity retention, Coulombic efficiency, and operational safety. Herein, a unified \u201cthree\u2010party synergistic\u201d strategy is developed. First, a dip\u2010coated amine\u2010functionalized glass fiber (NH2\u2010MIL\u2010125/GF) separator forms a polar, charged porous architecture that electrostatically adsorbs polyiodides while facilitating Zn2+ transport. Second, a hierarchically porous TiO2/NPC host, derived from the same NH2\u2010MIL\u2010125 precursor, features dual micro\u2010/mesopores and an ultrahigh specific surface area, enabling amorphous iodine encapsulation and improve redox kinetics. Third, interfacial engineering modulates Zn2+ desolvation and promotes dense, uniform zinc plating. Full batteries (Zn||NH2\u2010MIL\u2010125/GF||I2@TiO2/NPC) deliver a high reversible capacity of 215\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 0.05\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121, maintain 118\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 2\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121, and maintain 88% of the initial capacity after 10\u00a0000 cycles at 2 A g\u22121, demonstrating exbatteriesent rate capability and long\u2010term cycling stability. This work not only pioneers the dual utilization of NH2\u2010MIL\u2010125 for both separator engineering and iodine host design but also establishes a scalable framework for constructing high\u2010performance, long\u2010life aqueous metal\u2010halide batteries.",

This perspective compares academic and industrial progress across regions, growth trends, and funding ecosystems. The investigation reveals a persistent mismatch between lab innovation and market adoption and comments on key structural factors that delay scaling and industrial growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOrganic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are two great frontrunners of emerging photovoltaic technologies with flexible, lightweight, and efficient energy solutions. Regardless of significant efficiency improvements and prospering scientific progress, commercialization remains limited. This article investigates the misalignment between research activity and industrial standpoint, based on a bibliometric study of more than 28,000 research outputs and data regarding more than 100 companies. The key findings suggest that while lab\u2010scale performance is advancing, a lack of market trust inhibits industrial advancement. The absence of trusted business models, standardization, and weak industrial collaborations worsens the commercialization gap. These suggestions on closing the gap are through collaborative efforts toward standardization, de\u2010risking scaling pathways, and revision of market success.",
