    "content": "Constructing a structurally stable Superlattice\u2010V2O5 cathode with an ultra\u2010large interlayer spacing effectively suppresses vanadium dissolution and the resulting shuttle effect. Furthermore, the spacious ion channels and lower Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier enhance the active material utilization in thick electrodes. Ultimately, it enables zinc\u2010vanadium batteries with high specific capacity and ultra\u2010long cycle stability at low current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc\u2010vanadium batteries face severe capacity decay and rapid failure, particularly at low current densities (< 1 A g\u22121), primarily due to the poor structural stability of the vanadium cathode and corrosion by highly active free water, which severely hinders their practical application. Here, we propose the superlattice vanadium oxide (Superlattice\u2010V2O5) as a cathode material to improve the cycle stability at low current density. Its larger interlayer spacing of 21.5 \u00c5 reduces structural stress during hydrated Zn2+ insertion/extraction, thus mitigating structural collapse, and effectively weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the interlayer. Furthermore, the superlattice structure diminishes the release of highly active water molecules during the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and increases the dissolution energy of the VO2+ ion from 0.96 to 1.72\u00a0eV. These synergistic effects suppress vanadium dissolution and shuttling. Consequently, the Superlattice\u2010V2O5 achieves a specific capacity of 445.1 mAh g\u22121 at a low current density of 0.2 A g\u22121 and enables vanadium shuttle\u2010free cycling for 750 cycles (lasting 106 days). Furthermore, the superlattice structure facilitates ion insertion into the deep regions of the high mass loading electrode, which effectively improves active material utilization, thereby achieving a stability of 2800 cycles at 0.5 A g\u22121 with a mass loading of 19.3\u00a0mg cm\u22122.",

    "content": "A novel bipolar electrochromic architecture based on WO3 and polycarbazole enables panchromatic modulation from visible to NIR. This device achieves a remarkable 77.4% integrated optical contrast with fast switching (1.0 s/0.7 s) and outstanding cycling stability (95% retention after 20\u00a0000 cycles), paving the way for next\u2010generation smart windows with validated significant energy savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochromic technology has garnered significant attention for smart windows due to its dynamic solar regulation capability. However, current implementations suffer from limitations such as low optical contrast, slow switching speed, and poor cycling stability. This study addresses these challenges by designing a bipolar electrochromic architecture combining thermally\u2010cured WO3 and alkoxy\u2010functionalized polycarbazole derivatives (CTPAO1 and CTPAO3). The optimized ECD2 (based on WO3 and CTPAO3) achieves a comprehensive contrast of 77.4% (200\u20132350\u00a0nm) with a peak modulation of 87.5% at 730\u00a0nm. The device exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 95% of its optical contrast after 20\u00a0000 cycles. Notably, benefiting from efficient ion transport pathways, it also shows excellent switching kinetics with a coloration time of 1.0 s and a bleaching time of 0.7 s. Building energy efficiency simulations predict that smart windows incorporating ECD2 can achieve total annual energy savings ranging from 13.1% to 50.8% across five climate zones in China. The energy\u2010saving effect is particularly significant in Haikou, with an estimated annual saving of 56.5\u00a0kW h/m2. This work provides a feasible solution for high\u2010performance, energy\u2010efficient electrochromic smart windows.",

The prepared Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 cathode delivers a high energy density (\u223c425 Wh kg\u22121) and outstanding cycling stability (95.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 20 C), offering a promising strategy for advanced sodium\u2010ion battery development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nConstructing cathode materials combining high operating voltage with long\u2010term stability is critical for sodium\u2013ion batteries (SIBs). Although Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising candidate, its practical application is limited by low intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural distortion at high voltages. Herein, we regulate the configurational entropy by co\u2013introducing Cr3+, Al3+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ into NVP to develop a novel Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 (NVMP) cathode. Through the successful activation of the reversible V4+/V5+ redox couple at \u223c4.0\u00a0V, the configurational entropy regulation strategy in NVMP effectively enhances the intrinsic electronic conductivity and reaction kinetics. Concurrently, it optimizes the phase transition behavior during (de)intercalation, which collectively contributes to superior rate capability and long\u2013term cycling stability. As a result, NVMP exhibits an average operating voltage of 3.64\u00a0V and a high energy density of approximately 425\u00a0Wh\u00a0kg\u22121. Notably, it retains 95.9% of its initial capacity after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 20 C, demonstrating exceptional cycling stability.

As a result, L/D\u2010IrO2 delivers excellent PEMWE performance and high\u2010current durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nActivating robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pathways in acidic media remains a major challenge for scalable hydrogen production via proton\u2010exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, we report a lithiation/delithiation (L/D) engineering strategy that enables a mechanistic switch in IrO2 from the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to a radical oxygen coupling pathway. This transition is driven by two cooperative effects: shortened Ir\u2013Ir distances that geometrically favor O\u2013O coupling; and enhanced oxygen hole formation on adsorbed oxygen species (*Oads), promoting the generation of reactive Oads2\u2212x like intermediates. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate that these geometric and electronic modulations synergistically activate direct (*Oads\u2013*Oads) coupling. The L/D\u2010IrO2 catalyst achieves an ultralow OER overpotential of 204\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and delivers outstanding durability over 1200\u00a0h in 0.5\u00a0m H2SO4.

    "content": "The synergistic strategies enable the progressive optimization of thermoelectric performance in n\u2010type PbSe crystals. Heterovalent doping regulates the carrier concentration, while lattice plainification promotes the room\u2010temperature ZT, enabling the cooling device to attain a maximum temperature difference of 66.3 K. Furthermore, interstitial doping enhances the average ZT, with the single\u2010leg device achieving a maximum power generation efficiency of 8.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPbSe crystals exhibit significant potential for development in thermoelectric cooling and power generation applications due to their high\u2010ranged thermoelectric performance. Herein, we achieve lattice plainification in n\u2010type PbSe crystals through Ge doping and additional Ge incorporation, leading to a ZT value of 0.7 at room temperature in n\u2010type Pb0.993Ge0.007Se+0.0015Ge crystals.

Furthermore, the introduction of interstitial Cu enables a broad\u2010temperature\u2010range enhancement of thermoelectric performance. A high average ZT value of 1.07 can be obtained in Pb0.993Ge0.007Se+0.0015Ge+0.0012Cu crystal across the 303\u2013673 K, as well as a single\u2010leg device exhibits a peak power generation efficiency of 8.7% under the temperature gradient of 423 K.

    "content": "This study establishes an in situ electrochemical framework using dense bulk electrodes to identify defect chemistry and surface kinetics. While oxygen vacancy concentration is derived via bias modulation, surface exchange coefficients are quantified at open circuit voltage conditions to isolate kinetics. This decoupling reveals surface\u2010specific degradation while bulk thermodynamics remain stable, bridging model studies and practical solid oxide cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) employ mixed ionic\u2013electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite electrodes, where electrochemical performance is dictated by the oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k) and the concentration of oxygen vacancies (\u03b4). Conventional methods evaluate k and \u03b4 separately and under conditions that do not reflect their coupled behavior during operation, offering only a partial picture of the underlying processes. Here we report an in situ methodology that simultaneously resolves k and \u03b4 under realistic SOC operating conditions, using a dense bulk electrode integrated with a solid electrolyte. An applied overpotential induces an abrupt drop in the oxygen chemical potential gradient, enabling direct analysis of defect chemistry and surface reaction kinetics. The extracted values are consistent with those obtained from established characterization methods, validating the accuracy of the approach. Beyond fundamental characterization, the platform captures dynamic evolutions in defect chemistry and reaction kinetics, providing mechanistic insights into electrode degradation.",

    "content": "Here, we develop a methodology to examine the active site availability of immobilized transition\u2010metal molecular complexes via cyclic voltammetry. By using varying loadings of the molecular complex FeTPP physically immobilized onto Vulcan Carbon, we show the influences of FeTPP/VC ratios on the total number of active sites. The work further provides general guidelines for ink optimization for redox\u2010based applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAs molecular catalysts are increasingly employed in heterogenized systems such as CO2 electroreduction, a need arises for more systematic approaches to characterize their preparation, distribution, and activity. Current means of classifying electroactive versus spectator molecules are insufficient, while improvement of ink formulations, depositions, and distributions relies primarily on indirect links to electrochemical performance. In this study, we expand the common utilization of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in homogeneous systems toward heterogenized molecular catalyst architectures. We illustrate how, even with porous catalyst layers containing carbon, ionomer, and molecules, a combined redox wave integration and UV\u2010vis analysis can be used as a tool for designing a reproducible deposition procedure. An in\u2010depth CV analysis is then used to study the effect of catalyst aggregation and quantify the number of electroactive sites on carbon supports. We show that FeTPP (Iron(III)meso\u2010tetraphenylporphyrin chloride) gives a non\u2010linear electroactive response when loading is varied, allowing for the identification of distinct loading regions of insufficient, optimal, and excessive coverage. A FeTPP to Vulcan carbon mass ratio of 0.1 provides the highest number of electroactive species, giving the lowest expected aggregation. Overall, the CV approaches are extendable to any redox\u2010active catalysts, providing a versatile means of characterizing porous heterogeneous molecular catalyst systems.",

    "content": "Lanthanum\u2010tantalum perovskite oxynitride monolayers, containing both high nitrogen uptake and low defect content, are fabricated by a charge\u2010balanced nitridation strategy. These monolayers can stably drive photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light up to 600\u00a0nm, benefitting from easy dissociation and facile migration of photo\u2010generated charge carriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSunlight\u2010driven photocatalytic overall water splitting is a promising means for a sustainable production of hydrogen with zero carbon footprint. For efficient solar energy conversions, this reaction should be conducted over narrow bandgap semiconductors with sufficient utilization of photo\u2010generated charge carriers. However, interference of charge carrier movement by defects often leads to poor access of charges to the reaction, accounting for substantial efficiency losses. In this work, a charge\u2010balanced nitridation strategy is applied to modulate the defect content in lanthanum\u2010tantalum perovskite oxynitride monolayers. Compared with conventional nitridation, which is charge\u2010imbalanced, the charge\u2010balanced one brings a desired combination of high nitrogen uptake for intense visible light absorption and low defect content for efficient charge carrier separation and migration. By depositing Pt nanoparticles and coating an amorphous layer of titanium oxyhydroxide, the modulated monolayers can photocatalyze overall water splitting with high stability, delivering an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.34% at 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0nm and a solar\u2010to\u2010hydrogen efficiency of 0.018%. This work signifies the usefulness of charge\u2010balanced nitridation for defect control, which shall reinvigorate many other metal oxynitrides for photocatalytic overall water splitting.",
