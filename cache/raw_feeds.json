    "content": "Constructing a structurally stable Superlattice\u2010V2O5 cathode with an ultra\u2010large interlayer spacing effectively suppresses vanadium dissolution and the resulting shuttle effect. Furthermore, the spacious ion channels and lower Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier enhance the active material utilization in thick electrodes. Ultimately, it enables zinc\u2010vanadium batteries with high specific capacity and ultra\u2010long cycle stability at low current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc\u2010vanadium batteries face severe capacity decay and rapid failure, particularly at low current densities (< 1 A g\u22121), primarily due to the poor structural stability of the vanadium cathode and corrosion by highly active free water, which severely hinders their practical application. Here, we propose the superlattice vanadium oxide (Superlattice\u2010V2O5) as a cathode material to improve the cycle stability at low current density. Its larger interlayer spacing of 21.5 \u00c5 reduces structural stress during hydrated Zn2+ insertion/extraction, thus mitigating structural collapse, and effectively weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the interlayer. Furthermore, the superlattice structure diminishes the release of highly active water molecules during the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and increases the dissolution energy of the VO2+ ion from 0.96 to 1.72\u00a0eV. These synergistic effects suppress vanadium dissolution and shuttling. Consequently, the Superlattice\u2010V2O5 achieves a specific capacity of 445.1 mAh g\u22121 at a low current density of 0.2 A g\u22121 and enables vanadium shuttle\u2010free cycling for 750 cycles (lasting 106 days). Furthermore, the superlattice structure facilitates ion insertion into the deep regions of the high mass loading electrode, which effectively improves active material utilization, thereby achieving a stability of 2800 cycles at 0.5 A g\u22121 with a mass loading of 19.3\u00a0mg cm\u22122.",

    "content": "A novel bipolar electrochromic architecture based on WO3 and polycarbazole enables panchromatic modulation from visible to NIR. This device achieves a remarkable 77.4% integrated optical contrast with fast switching (1.0 s/0.7 s) and outstanding cycling stability (95% retention after 20\u00a0000 cycles), paving the way for next\u2010generation smart windows with validated significant energy savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochromic technology has garnered significant attention for smart windows due to its dynamic solar regulation capability. However, current implementations suffer from limitations such as low optical contrast, slow switching speed, and poor cycling stability. This study addresses these challenges by designing a bipolar electrochromic architecture combining thermally\u2010cured WO3 and alkoxy\u2010functionalized polycarbazole derivatives (CTPAO1 and CTPAO3). The optimized ECD2 (based on WO3 and CTPAO3) achieves a comprehensive contrast of 77.4% (200\u20132350\u00a0nm) with a peak modulation of 87.5% at 730\u00a0nm. The device exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 95% of its optical contrast after 20\u00a0000 cycles. Notably, benefiting from efficient ion transport pathways, it also shows excellent switching kinetics with a coloration time of 1.0 s and a bleaching time of 0.7 s. Building energy efficiency simulations predict that smart windows incorporating ECD2 can achieve total annual energy savings ranging from 13.1% to 50.8% across five climate zones in China. The energy\u2010saving effect is particularly significant in Haikou, with an estimated annual saving of 56.5\u00a0kW h/m2. This work provides a feasible solution for high\u2010performance, energy\u2010efficient electrochromic smart windows.",

The prepared Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 cathode delivers a high energy density (\u223c425 Wh kg\u22121) and outstanding cycling stability (95.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 20 C), offering a promising strategy for advanced sodium\u2010ion battery development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nConstructing cathode materials combining high operating voltage with long\u2010term stability is critical for sodium\u2013ion batteries (SIBs). Although Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising candidate, its practical application is limited by low intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural distortion at high voltages. Herein, we regulate the configurational entropy by co\u2013introducing Cr3+, Al3+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ into NVP to develop a novel Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 (NVMP) cathode. Through the successful activation of the reversible V4+/V5+ redox couple at \u223c4.0\u00a0V, the configurational entropy regulation strategy in NVMP effectively enhances the intrinsic electronic conductivity and reaction kinetics. Concurrently, it optimizes the phase transition behavior during (de)intercalation, which collectively contributes to superior rate capability and long\u2013term cycling stability. As a result, NVMP exhibits an average operating voltage of 3.64\u00a0V and a high energy density of approximately 425\u00a0Wh\u00a0kg\u22121. Notably, it retains 95.9% of its initial capacity after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 20 C, demonstrating exceptional cycling stability.

As a result, L/D\u2010IrO2 delivers excellent PEMWE performance and high\u2010current durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nActivating robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pathways in acidic media remains a major challenge for scalable hydrogen production via proton\u2010exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, we report a lithiation/delithiation (L/D) engineering strategy that enables a mechanistic switch in IrO2 from the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to a radical oxygen coupling pathway. This transition is driven by two cooperative effects: shortened Ir\u2013Ir distances that geometrically favor O\u2013O coupling; and enhanced oxygen hole formation on adsorbed oxygen species (*Oads), promoting the generation of reactive Oads2\u2212x like intermediates. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate that these geometric and electronic modulations synergistically activate direct (*Oads\u2013*Oads) coupling. The L/D\u2010IrO2 catalyst achieves an ultralow OER overpotential of 204\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and delivers outstanding durability over 1200\u00a0h in 0.5\u00a0m H2SO4.

    "content": "The synergistic strategies enable the progressive optimization of thermoelectric performance in n\u2010type PbSe crystals. Heterovalent doping regulates the carrier concentration, while lattice plainification promotes the room\u2010temperature ZT, enabling the cooling device to attain a maximum temperature difference of 66.3 K. Furthermore, interstitial doping enhances the average ZT, with the single\u2010leg device achieving a maximum power generation efficiency of 8.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPbSe crystals exhibit significant potential for development in thermoelectric cooling and power generation applications due to their high\u2010ranged thermoelectric performance. Herein, we achieve lattice plainification in n\u2010type PbSe crystals through Ge doping and additional Ge incorporation, leading to a ZT value of 0.7 at room temperature in n\u2010type Pb0.993Ge0.007Se+0.0015Ge crystals.

Furthermore, the introduction of interstitial Cu enables a broad\u2010temperature\u2010range enhancement of thermoelectric performance. A high average ZT value of 1.07 can be obtained in Pb0.993Ge0.007Se+0.0015Ge+0.0012Cu crystal across the 303\u2013673 K, as well as a single\u2010leg device exhibits a peak power generation efficiency of 8.7% under the temperature gradient of 423 K.

    "content": "This study establishes an in situ electrochemical framework using dense bulk electrodes to identify defect chemistry and surface kinetics. While oxygen vacancy concentration is derived via bias modulation, surface exchange coefficients are quantified at open circuit voltage conditions to isolate kinetics. This decoupling reveals surface\u2010specific degradation while bulk thermodynamics remain stable, bridging model studies and practical solid oxide cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) employ mixed ionic\u2013electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite electrodes, where electrochemical performance is dictated by the oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k) and the concentration of oxygen vacancies (\u03b4). Conventional methods evaluate k and \u03b4 separately and under conditions that do not reflect their coupled behavior during operation, offering only a partial picture of the underlying processes. Here we report an in situ methodology that simultaneously resolves k and \u03b4 under realistic SOC operating conditions, using a dense bulk electrode integrated with a solid electrolyte. An applied overpotential induces an abrupt drop in the oxygen chemical potential gradient, enabling direct analysis of defect chemistry and surface reaction kinetics. The extracted values are consistent with those obtained from established characterization methods, validating the accuracy of the approach. Beyond fundamental characterization, the platform captures dynamic evolutions in defect chemistry and reaction kinetics, providing mechanistic insights into electrode degradation.",

    "content": "Here, we develop a methodology to examine the active site availability of immobilized transition\u2010metal molecular complexes via cyclic voltammetry. By using varying loadings of the molecular complex FeTPP physically immobilized onto Vulcan Carbon, we show the influences of FeTPP/VC ratios on the total number of active sites. The work further provides general guidelines for ink optimization for redox\u2010based applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAs molecular catalysts are increasingly employed in heterogenized systems such as CO2 electroreduction, a need arises for more systematic approaches to characterize their preparation, distribution, and activity. Current means of classifying electroactive versus spectator molecules are insufficient, while improvement of ink formulations, depositions, and distributions relies primarily on indirect links to electrochemical performance. In this study, we expand the common utilization of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in homogeneous systems toward heterogenized molecular catalyst architectures. We illustrate how, even with porous catalyst layers containing carbon, ionomer, and molecules, a combined redox wave integration and UV\u2010vis analysis can be used as a tool for designing a reproducible deposition procedure. An in\u2010depth CV analysis is then used to study the effect of catalyst aggregation and quantify the number of electroactive sites on carbon supports. We show that FeTPP (Iron(III)meso\u2010tetraphenylporphyrin chloride) gives a non\u2010linear electroactive response when loading is varied, allowing for the identification of distinct loading regions of insufficient, optimal, and excessive coverage. A FeTPP to Vulcan carbon mass ratio of 0.1 provides the highest number of electroactive species, giving the lowest expected aggregation. Overall, the CV approaches are extendable to any redox\u2010active catalysts, providing a versatile means of characterizing porous heterogeneous molecular catalyst systems.",

    "content": "Lanthanum\u2010tantalum perovskite oxynitride monolayers, containing both high nitrogen uptake and low defect content, are fabricated by a charge\u2010balanced nitridation strategy. These monolayers can stably drive photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light up to 600\u00a0nm, benefitting from easy dissociation and facile migration of photo\u2010generated charge carriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSunlight\u2010driven photocatalytic overall water splitting is a promising means for a sustainable production of hydrogen with zero carbon footprint. For efficient solar energy conversions, this reaction should be conducted over narrow bandgap semiconductors with sufficient utilization of photo\u2010generated charge carriers. However, interference of charge carrier movement by defects often leads to poor access of charges to the reaction, accounting for substantial efficiency losses. In this work, a charge\u2010balanced nitridation strategy is applied to modulate the defect content in lanthanum\u2010tantalum perovskite oxynitride monolayers. Compared with conventional nitridation, which is charge\u2010imbalanced, the charge\u2010balanced one brings a desired combination of high nitrogen uptake for intense visible light absorption and low defect content for efficient charge carrier separation and migration. By depositing Pt nanoparticles and coating an amorphous layer of titanium oxyhydroxide, the modulated monolayers can photocatalyze overall water splitting with high stability, delivering an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.34% at 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0nm and a solar\u2010to\u2010hydrogen efficiency of 0.018%. This work signifies the usefulness of charge\u2010balanced nitridation for defect control, which shall reinvigorate many other metal oxynitrides for photocatalytic overall water splitting.",

    "content": "This review bridges practical fast\u2010charging protocols with fundamental mechanisms of SOC\u2010dependent structural and compositional changes in electrode materials, kinetic limitations such as polarization and inhomogeneity, and heat generation characteristics shaped by protocol design. Integrating operando diagnostics, real\u2010time sensing, multiscale modelling, and data\u2010driven analysis, it outlines a unified framework for understanding and optimizing lithium\u2010ion battery fast charging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe rapid growth of lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) applications drives the need for fast\u2010charging solutions ensuring speed, safety, durability, and performance. Such charging protocol design needs to be guided by mechanistic understanding of degradation pathways, ionic transport limitations, and thermal constraints. However, in practice, many charging protocols used in commercial electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) have limited mechanistic transparency. In this review, we adopt a reverse perspective by extracting mechanistic insights from practical charging protocols to inform future design. To this end, standardized fast\u2010charging protocols and those implemented in real\u2010world applications such as smartphones and EVs are analyzed to examine how their voltage\u2013current profiles evolve with state\u2010of\u2010charge (SOC) and to reflect distinct design rationales. These features are further examined in terms of SOC\u2010dependent physical and chemical transformations in electrode materials, kinetic limitations such as polarization and reaction heterogeneity influenced by charging protocol design, and distinct heat generation patterns governed by protocol characteristics. Advanced characterization techniques are then highlighted for providing real\u2010time insights into structural transitions, diffusion kinetics, and heat evolution during fast charging. Finally, future protocol design may be informed by multiscale material modelling, real\u2010time sensing for adaptive control, and data\u2010driven optimization to support the development of advanced fast\u2010charging systems.",

With the rapid development of advanced characterization techniques and accurate theoretical calculations, remarkable progress has been achieved in elucidating the intrinsic nature of SMSI and in the rational reverse design of novel catalyst architectures. SMSI is characterized by several distinctive features, including the formation of protective encapsulation layers, significant electron transfer across the interface, and dynamic redispersion of metal species. Furthermore, strategies for constructing SMSI in various reactions are classified and discussed in detail to guide the development of new heterogeneous catalytic systems, providing valuable guidance for the design of efficient and durable catalytic systems. Finally, common research methods for SMSI catalysts are summarized from the perspectives of advanced in situ characterization techniques and theoretical modeling methods, which enable a deeper understanding of SMSI phenomena.

A well\u2010designed workflow integrating high\u2010throughput and machine learning approaches is highlighted to pave the highway for advanced catalyst discovery by accelerating numerous catalysts screening, elucidating reaction mechanisms, and determining critical descriptors. Future directions on automated screening platforms, advanced in situ characterization, and intelligent ML algorithms are presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThere is growing interest in highly active catalysts to meet the increasing requirements of high\u2010efficiency energy conversion and storage. However, catalyst investigation through traditional trial\u2010and\u2010error experiments is impeded by the long duration and high cost involved. Recently, high\u2010throughput (HT) technologies that enable rapid catalyst screening in a vast parameter space within days (or even hours) have revolutionized catalyst research. Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from large datasets generated by HT experiments and computational calculations. The integration of HT with ML technologies demonstrates great promise for facilitating the discovery of advanced catalysts. From this perspective, this study highlights the use of frameworks integrating HT experimental/computational techniques with ML methodologies for catalyst research, with emphasis on the progress in such frameworks in identifying optimal candidates, elucidating reaction mechanisms, and determining critical descriptors. Furthermore, future directions for accelerating high\u2010performance catalyst discovery using automated HT synthesis platforms, advanced in situ characterization, and intelligent ML algorithms are outlined. This work is expected to establish a closed\u2010loop workflow toward the design of highly active catalysts and provide a new avenue for fundamental theory and practical applications in catalyst research.",

This review investigates the electrochemical conversion of nitrogenous molecules to value\u2010added products using a metal (M) phthalocyanine (Pc)\u2010based electrocatalyst. The review is mostly focused on nitrogen reduction to ammonia, nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonia, nitrogen oxidation to nitric acid, urea formation from dinitrogen (N2)/nitrogenous oxide (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction at the same time, and other similar reactions. This review aims for alternatives to traditional methods that consume significant amounts of energy and emit a lot of greenhouse gases by using cutting\u2010edge electrocatalyst engineering and a thorough understanding of how they work. A lot of various types of phthalocyanine systems have shown promise as catalysts for electrochemical applications. A better understanding of reaction mechanism and catalyst stability has been achieved through computational modeling and electrochemical characterization (including in situ study). Another focus is to highlight recent advancements, problems, and potential future directions in developing environmentally friendly, scalable, and efficient electrocatalytic systems for the transformation of nitrogen and carbon\u2010based reactants to generate value\u2010added products.",

    "content": "This review summarizes the design principles and research progress of functional separators for aqueous zinc\u2010based batteries (AZBBs) across electrolytes of varying pH. It addresses challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions, the shuttle effect, and electrode contradictions through specific modification strategies, and outlines future development directions to facilitate the commercialization of these promising AZBBs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAqueous zinc\u2010based batteries (AZBBs) have become promising candidates for large\u2010scale grid energy storage due to their advantages of high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, whether it is alkaline batteries or acidic/neutral batteries, issues such as the growth of zinc dendrites, side reactions, shuttle effects, and electrode contradictions have hindered the further development of AZBBs. The functionalized separator modification strategy has been proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the stability of anodes or cathodes. To this day, the inherent mechanism of functional separators in different pH electrolyte environments remains unclear. Therefore, this review first introduces the requirements for functional separators under different pH electrolyte environments and corresponding design principles. Then, the research progress of AZBBs functional separators under different pH aqueous solution systems is summarized. Subsequently, in response to the four main problems faced by AZBBs mentioned above, the corresponding modification strategies and mechanisms are introduced in detail. Finally, the development of functional separators in AZBBs is prospected, aiming to promote the commercialization path of the booming AZBBs.",

    "content": "Silicon\u2010carbon anodes suffer from thermal runaway (TR) due to exothermic electrolyte reactions. Tripropargyl phosphate (TPP) is introduced as a dual\u2010functional additive, scavenging protons to suppress H2 and forming a stable SEI. TPP raises TR onset temperature, lowers peak temperature by 30\u00a0\u00b0C, and improves cycling. This strategy enhances safety for high\u2010energy batteries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSilicon\u2013carbon (Si\u2500C) anodes enable high energy density but suffer from poor thermal safety due to their strong reactivity with electrolytes. In this work, we identify the thermochemical reaction mechanism between lithiated silicon and carbonate solvents, revealing the formation of Si\u2500C bonds as direct evidence of electrolyte decomposition. Density functional theory calculations confirm the reaction's spontaneity, establishing that the deteriorated safety of Si\u2500C cells originates from the intrinsic Si\u2013electrolyte reaction that intensifies anode\u2013cathode crosstalk during thermal runaway. To validate this mechanism, tripropargyl phosphate (TPP) is introduced as an electrolyte additive. Its alkyne groups effectively scavenge protons and suppress hydrogen generation, leading to reduced gas evolution and delayed exothermic onset. Compared with the FEC system, the TPP\u2010based electrolyte demonstrates lower H2 release and reduced thermal runaway peak temperature by 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, TPP facilitates the formation of a uniform and inorganic\u2010rich SEI, enhancing interfacial stability and cycling performance. This study provides new insights into the design of safer high\u2010energy Si\u2010based lithium\u2010ion batteries.",

    "content": "In this perspective, a strategic shift in organic photodetector (OPD) research is proposed: instead of the incremental advances in silicon's stronghold arena, the most impactful future for OPDs lies in addressing silicon's intrinsic limitations, i.e., detection in the longer wavelength range above silicon's coverage (>1100 nm, termed as near infrared\u2010II) and realizing detectors that are mechanically conformable for new\u2010age applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nPhotodetectors (PDs) based on organic materials have evolved as a compelling alternative to inorganic PDs, specifically in domains where inorganic materials have limitations in terms of spectral coverage and intrinsic mechanical characteristics. This perspective emphasizes the importance of strategic research efforts toward promising functional domains, such as conformable and near infrared\u2010II photodetection. In such contexts, organic photodetectors (OPDs) are highly valued due to their tunable spectral coverage, conformability, and favorable sustainability metrics. The transformative advances in recent years, specifically in conformable and NIR\u2010II domains, are first outlined. Building on this, a future roadmap with key strategies on application\u2010specific device/material innovations, interface engineering targeting low\u2010bandgap material systems, and end\u2010use dependent operational stability analysis is proposed. Finally, the pathways for translating lab\u2010scale breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies are discussed, underscoring the urgent need to adopt sustainable design/manufacturing practices with end use in mind, to integrate regulatory and sustainability metrics into the academic research for market readiness, and to ensure system integration with existing product ecosystem. By positioning the future research efforts into untapped domains, rather than incremental advancements in silicon's stronghold arenas, this perspective aims to motivate the research community to work toward targeted and application\u2010driven innovations and breakthroughs in OPDs.",

    "content": "This work identifies an unprecedented dimension to activate ion intercalation of potential low\u2010expansion materials, avoiding the inherent high\u2010expansion of conventional regulatory dimension that rely on stress release. Two quantitative descriptors coordinate the antagonistic conflict of phase stability during activation ion intercalation. This allows us to provide a unified landscape of intercalation chemistry activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nReversible ion intercalation chemistry underpins rocking\u2010chair batteries and smart ionic switching devices. Conventional intercalation activation relies on ion\u2010host distance and electronegativity, confining regulations to stress\u2010release dimension in carbon and silicon\u2010based materials associated with high expansion and mechanical degradation. However, this paradigm fails in regulating low\u2010expansion materials for mitigating degradation, because stress arising from the constrained volume blocks functional intercalation. Herein, we harness ion\u2010host binding strength derived from thermodynamic decoupling as a widely applicable intercalation activation dimension, whose regulation can be realized by transferring electrons to host low\u2010energy orbital, and thus propose two quantitative descriptors to coordinate the antagonistic conflict between the binding strength and phase stability. Accordingly, we provide three types of cases to demonstrate its utility and applications, ranging from commercial carbon\u2010based electrodes to intractable covalent nitrides. The consideration of ion\u2010host binding strength sheds light on why graphite accommodates Li\u2010 but not Na\u2010ion. \u03b1\u2010VSi2N4 prototype tuned from MSi2N4 (M = Transition metal) family achieves a Na\u2010ion capacity of 163\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 with merely 5.6% expansion, surpassing the near\u2010zero\u2010expansion Na4Ti5O12 benchmark by over 30%. This work establishes the intercalation chemistry activation landscape by exploring unprecedented regulation dimension, broadening the scope for the selective design of energy storage materials and beyond.",

The resulting devices achieve 23.45% (rigid) and 22.1% (flexible) power conversion efficiencies\u2013exceeding previous reports on sputtered NiO n\u2010i\u2010p devices\u2013and establish a scalable pathway toward stable, high\u2010performance PSCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe integration of inorganic materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for enhancing long\u2010term operational stability, scalability, and economic viability. Here, we demonstrate the transformational efficacy of using a modified protocol for sputtered nickel oxide as a hole transport layer (HTL) in n\u2013i\u2013p structured PSCs, in conjunction with a thin Spiro\u2010OMeTAD buffer layer. The introduction of a biased grid and a buffer interface enable us to achieve a soft landing of NiO on the halide perovskite, thereby minimizing process\u2010induced interfacial damage. Our results indicate that the buffer layer serves solely as an interfacial protection layer, rather than as a functional HTL. Using this approach, we report champion power conversion efficiencies of 23.45% (mean \u224822.2%) on rigid glass substrates and 22.1% (mean \u224821%) on flexible ITO\u2010coated PET substrates, both employing fully inorganic charge transport layers. These results represent unprecedented enhancements over previously reported highest PCE values (<12%) for n\u2010i\u2010p devices using sputtered NiO as the HTL, placing them on par with p\u2010i\u2010n architectures that utilize a combination of NiO and organic HTLs. This work demonstrates a scalable, commercially viable pathway toward high\u2010efficiency, stable perovskite photovoltaics based solely on sputtered inorganic layers, offering a competitive edge for further development.",

    "content": "A bi\u2010phase electron\u2010rich reagent for both precise delamination and structural restoration of the spent cathode materials within a single chemical system was developed, eliminating the need for different chemicals in the delamination and regeneration steps. The reagent is reusable for over ten cycles, while regenerated LFP delivers a 39.5% increase in capacity, highlighting an efficient and sustainable recycling strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nEfficient recycling of spent lithium\u2010ion battery cathodes remains both critical and challenging. Achieving high\u2010purity separation hinges on the precise delamination of active materials from current collectors, which directly influences downstream recycling efficiency. Guided by density functional theory, we develop a versatile strategy that enables rapid, high\u2010efficiency delamination by first deactivating the binder, followed by structural restoration of the separated LiFePO4 (LFP) through electron activation using a designed bi\u2010phase electron\u2010rich reagent (BER). Experimentally, the approach attains > 99% separation efficiency for LFP and multiple electrode chemistries within minutes, while fully preserving the structural integrity of both active materials and metal foils. The phase I BER (BER\u2010I) maintains stable performance over more than ten cycles after simple zeolite purification, showing negligible changes in viscosity or chemical composition. Notably, BER\u2010I can be converted in situ into a repairing phase II BER that replenishes lithium loss and heals structural defects, enabling direct regeneration. The regenerated LFP delivers a specific capacity of 154.7 mAh g\u22121 at 0.1 C, while its 0.5 Ah pouch cell maintains 91.1% capacity after 400 cycles at 1 C. Techno\u2010economic analysis further reveals that this integrated separation\u2010regeneration route offers a more sustainable and economically advantageous solution than existing recycling processes.",

Meanwhile, advanced strategies including molecular engineering and multi\u2010component synergy are proposed to promote the industrial deployment of high\u2010performance aqueous zinc\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSaccharide additives have recently emerged as a green, low\u2010cost, and highly efficient strategy to stabilize Zn metal anodes. Previously reported monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and their derivatives can effectively suppress dendrite growth, prolong cycle life, and push Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.0%. However, most investigations focus on a single saccharide and its specific mechanism, lacking a systematic review and horizontal comparison of the relationship between the molecular structure and regulatory mechanism, which limits the rational design and performance optimization of saccharide additives. This review comprehensively summarizes and deeply analyzes the common principles by which saccharide additives regulate Zn2+ solvation, suppress hydrogen evolution, construct water\u2010poor interface layers, optimize interfacial electric field, and induce oriented Zn2+ deposition. This review elucidates the structure\u2010function relationships across different categories of saccharide additives. The abundant oxygen\u2010containing functional groups, steric hindrance effects, and chain length of saccharide additives act synergistically to deliver a \u201cdesolvation\u2010confinement\u2010orientation\u201d triple function. This review further proposes forward\u2010looking strategies for molecular engineering and multi\u2010component synergy to address existing challenges, and aims to provide critical insights for the design and optimization of long\u2010lasting zinc\u2010based energy storage systems.",

This surface stabilization allows scalable slurry processing and stable cycling even under low pressure, offering a practical pathway to high\u2010performance all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAchieving chemical and electrochemical stability of sulfide\u2010based solid electrolytes is crucial for enabling practical slurry fabrication and reliable operation of all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs). Herein, a fluorocarbon\u2010terminated self\u2010assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy is reported that forms a conformal and chemically inert surface on Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), yielding a stabilized catholyte (\u2500CF3@LPSCl) compatible with polar solvent\u2010based processing. The SAM layer effectively suppresses nucleophilic degradation induced by ester solvents and moisture while maintaining the crystalline bulk structure and high ionic conductivity of LPSCl. The surface fluorination simultaneously enhances both chemical and electrochemical stability, characterized by X\u2010ray absorption near\u2010edge structure measurements, enabling high\u2010rate capability and stable cycling under 1.0 C conditions. Under low stack pressure (\u22480.3\u00a0MPa), the \u2500CF3@LPSCl catholyte suppresses not only the catholyte degradation but also alleviates mechanical contact loss within the cathode, achieving superior cycling stability without reliance on binder reinforcement. Notably, full cells assembled with thin Li metal and a low N/P ratio exhibit 90.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles. This work demonstrates that a simple but straightforward fabrication of surface\u2010stable catholyte\u2014beyond binder and electrode engineering\u2014can play a decisive role in achieving scalable and pressure\u2010tolerant ASSBs platforms.",

As a result, the NCM/SR\u2010LPSCl electrode delivers excellent capacity and cycling performance at high areal capacities of up to 15 mAh cm\u22122.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs) are gaining attention due to their high safety and energy density compared to those of conventional lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). However, insufficient contact between the cathode active material (CAM) and solid electrolyte (SE), or using a high proportion of SE in the cathode, hinders energy density improvements. Maintaining a low electrolyte proportion while ensuring sufficient Li\u2010ion pathways is challenging. This study elucidates the correlation between SE particle size distribution and electrode microstructure, as well as Li\u2010ion and charge transfer kinetics. A spray\u2010recrystallization method is introduced to control the size of SEs. Exquisite SE size control allows the intimate interface between CAM and SE as well as homogeneous SE distribution, enhancing Li\u2010ion transport kinetics and corresponding to reducing charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Li\u2010ion migration resistance (Rion). A full cell with an NCM/SR\u2010LPSCl cathode shows a reversible capacity of 171.6 mAh g\u22121, 74.1% cycle retention after 100 cycles, and 113.7 mAh g\u22121 at room temperature.

Finally, it evaluates the system's industrial viability, forming a complete logical progression from fundamentals to real\u2010world application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMetal\u2010organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis, primarily owing to their structural tunability and high porosity. However, the practical application of MOFs is hindered by severe structural degradation under harsh seawater conditions, which includes chloride corrosion, microbial attack, pH fluctuations, and electric field\u2010induced reconstruction. This review systematically elucidates the dynamic evolution mechanisms of MOFs during seawater electrolysis, with a focus on corrosion\u2010driven degradation, electric field\u2010mediated valence oscillation, and ligand reconfiguration. We explore adaptive design strategies such as self\u2010healing, heterojunction engineering, defect control, coordination modulation, and spatial confinement that enhance the durability and activity of MOF\u2010based catalysts. Notably, the paper highlights the transformative role of machine learning in accelerating the discovery and optimization of corrosion\u2010resistant MOFs through high\u2010throughput screening, inverse design, and dynamic descriptor integration. By bridging fundamental mechanisms with industrial\u2010scale applications, this work provides a comprehensive roadmap for designing dynamically adaptive MOF catalysts, thereby paving the way for sustainable and efficient green hydrogen production from seawater.",

This approach simultaneously passivates multi-site defects, enhances hole-selective contacts via dipole-induced energy alignment, and suppresses ion migration. This yields record efficiencies of 23.15% for 0.09 cm2 C-PSCs and 18.77% per active area for 10 cm2 semitransparent module (35.8% visible light transmittance).",

This architecture disrupts the inherent coupling between anionic oxygen redox and transition\u2010metal migration, stabilizes lattice oxygen, and suppresses voltage hysteresis and voltage decay during oxygen redox. The resulting P2\u2010Na0.76Li0.10Mg0.08Ni0.15Mn0.67O2 sustains a highly reversible solid\u2010solution reaction over 2.0\u20134.5 V, with negligible voltage hysteresis and voltage decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nP2\u2010type layered oxides, as promising cathode candidates for sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs), offer high working voltage and rapid Na+ transport, yet suffer from progressive voltage decay and structural instability at deep states of charge, due to detrimental P2\u2010O2 phase transitions and irreversible oxygen redox. Herein, we introduce a multiple\u2010center honeycomb ordering strategy that incorporates LiMn6, MgMn6, and intrinsic NiMn6 topology within the transition\u2010metal layers of P2\u2010Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 through rational Li/Mg co\u2010doping. We demonstrate that the LiMn6 order units disperse the NiMn6 superstructure domains to suppress long\u2010range phase evolution, while the MgMn6 motifs act as nanoscale anchors to immobilize Li+ within the TM slabs and prevent its migration during oxygen redox. This synergistic topological design sustains a highly reversible solid\u2010solution reaction over a wide voltage range of 2.0\u20134.5\u00a0V, with minimal voltage hysteresis and a voltage decay of 0.002\u00a0V per cycle. The resulting P2\u2010Na0.76Li0.10Mg0.08Ni0.15Mn0.67O2 cathode delivers a high capcity of 134 mAh g\u22121 and retains an excellent capacity retention of 93.36% after 400 cycles, outperforming conventional analogues. These findings open a new avenue for tailoring the local structure of layered oxide cathodes to achieve voltage\u2010stable and high\u2010energy\u2010density SIBs.",

Polyanionic hydrogel buffers oxygen reduction and builds Donnan ion gradients, synchronizing chemical and interfacial electrokinetic currents. This strategy delivers a highly stable DC output, achieving an ultrahigh peak current density and directly charging capability for biofriendly micropower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectricity generation from interfacial molecular motion holds great promise for harvesting micro/nano energy for carbon neutrality and sustainable off\u2010grid power. Carbon materials and noble metals are normally treated as chemically inert electrodes even in such systems, potentially overestimating physical contributions and underutilizing chemical processes. Here, we achieve an ultrahigh current output via a dynamic liquid\u2010hydrogel interface through a synergistic physicochemical approach, by bridging a static graphite electrode and a dynamic hydrogel\u2010coated platinum electrode in saline. The hydrogel film containing poly(acrylic acid) is critical to both processes. Polyanionic poly(acrylic acid) serves as a proton reservoir, neutralizing hydroxide ions from the oxygen reduction reaction at the platinum surface (oxygen is ubiquitous in air), thereby providing a continuous chemical current; sharp ion concentration gradients form near the hydrogel/saline interface due to the Donnan effect, enabling physical charge separation by liquid flow during periodic immersion\u2010withdrawal cycles. Overall, this design delivers a direct\u2010current output with a peak current density of 2432\u00a0\u00b5A cm\u22122 and a transferred charge density over 1000 mC m\u22122 per cycle, surpassing existing counterparts. This work offers new insight into constructing high\u2010performance hydrovoltaic devices as green, scalable energy sources for self\u2010powered miniaturized systems and emerging energy infrastructures.",

These features collectively contribute to a high\u2010capacity, high\u2010rate, and ultra\u2010stable hard carbon anode, establishing a foundational principle for multi\u2010scale architectural engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHard carbons are among the most promising anode materials for sodium\u2010ion batteries, yet synergistic architectural control across multiple scales to improve comprehensive Na+ storage performances remains elusive. Herein, we propose a salt\u2010mediated micelle interfacial polymerization to fine nanospherical swelling/shrinkage and closed\u2010pore within nanoshells for excellent holistic Na+ storage. Metal salts screening reveals that Mn2+ promotes hollow sphere swelling via hydrolysis\u2010driven micelle expansion, while Cu2+ oxidatively polymerizes monomer within micelles, causing shrinkage to solid spheres. The hollow architecture enables bidirectional Na+ diffusion with >95% storage\u2010site utilization, outperforming unidirectional\u2010limited solid spheres with size\u2010dependent utilization. Meanwhile, this architecture, combined with 0D isotropy mitigates sodiation\u2010induced stress upon ultralong cycling. In situ salt\u2010induced expanded closed pores within the nanoscale shell enhance low\u2010potential capacity with fast kinetics. Such synergistic multi\u2010scale design leads to simultaneous exceptional high capacity of 324 mA g\u22121, outstanding rate capability retention of 90.5% at 1 A g\u22121, and unprecedented cyclic stability up to 20000 cycles with decay rate as low as 0.0014% per cycle. Negligible volume expansion (<0.0002 % per cycle) is observed for hollow spheres, nearly 15 times less than that of solid spheres (0.0026%).

Unlike solid\u2010state passivators, molten phosphonoalkanoic acid molecules penetrate deeply into bulk regions and access hidden defect sites that are otherwise unreachable. In the molten state, the phosphonic (\u2500PO3H2) and carboxylic (\u2500COOH) groups exhibit high conformational freedom, enabling spontaneous rotation and optimal spatial alignment to match the atomic arrangement of perovskite defects. The butane chain in 4\u2010PBA creates an ideal separation of 5.4\u20137.7 \u00c5 between its \u2500PO3H2 and \u2500COOH groups. This allows it to bridge the dual defects in adjacent [PbI6]4\u2212 octahedra, enabling cooperative dual\u2010site passivation. As a result, 1.68 eV wide\u2010bandgap PSCs employing this bulk\u2010doping strategy with the evaporation\u2010coating hybrid method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.53% (certified 21.95%) and show minimal efficiency degradation over time, demonstrating robust operational stability.",

    "content": "A MoV/Boridene catalyst with EMSIs effect has been achieved through a laser\u2010triggered self\u2010decomposition strategy exploiting the intrinsic instability of Boridene. These EMSIs in MoV/Boridene reinforce interfacial adhesion and durability, enhance charge transfer with LiO2/Li2O2, and accelerate ORR/OER kinetics in LOBs. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to Mo2C MXene, providing a versatile route for a range of materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n2D transition\u2010metal borides (MBenes), such as Boridene (Mo4/3B2Tx), exhibit excellent catalytic potential but suffer from instability, high resistivity, and loaded nanoparticle deactivation. Here, a laser\u2010triggered self\u2010decomposition strategy is developed to activate thermally unstable Boridene, cleaving Mo\u2500B bonds and producing defective Mo nanoparticles (MoV) that form electronic metal\u2010support interactions (EMSIs) with the Boridene substrate (MoV/Boridene). Analyses of Gibbs free energy and bond energetics confirm the intrinsic instability of Boridene, revealing that its negative Gibbs free energy and relatively weak Mo\u2500B bonds drive a thermodynamic propensity for controlled decomposition. Driven by EMSIs that enhance interface durability and optimize the electronic structure for accelerated oxygen electrocatalysis, the MoV/Boridene cathode achieves a low overpotential (0.32/0.40 V) and ultralong cyclability (550 cycles), surpassing most existing Mo\u2010based lithium\u2010oxygen batteries (LOBs) to date. This strategy is further demonstrated in another Mo2C MXene system with EMSI effects, establishing a versatile platform for activating MBenes/MXenes and expanding their potential applications in energy storage and conversion.",

The electrolyte remains unfrozen at \u221275\u00b0C, self\u2010heals within 10 min at \u221220\u00b0C, and suppresses parasitic reactions via Zn2+ solvation sheath reconstruction. Batteries exhibit 97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g\u22121 over an 80\u00b0C temperature range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe commercialization of aqueous zinc\u2010ion batteries is hampered by a fundamental paradox: electrolytes with anti\u2010freezing properties typically lack self\u2010healing capability, and vice versa. Herein, we decouple this trade\u2010off through the ingenious design of a synergistic network within a eutectogel electrolyte. This network is governed by strong Zn2+ coordination acting as rigid anchors, coupled with a dynamic quaternary hydrogen\u2010bond (HB) network involving glycerol, ClO4\u2212, water, and polyacrylamide serving as flexible bridges. In this configuration, the strong Zn2+ coordination and dense hydrogen bonds synergistically inhibit ice lattice formation to ensure anti\u2010freezing, while the reversible hydrogen bonds enable dynamic molecular reconfiguration for self\u2010healing. The resulting gel remains ice\u2010free at \u221275\u00b0C and self\u2010heals within 10 min even at \u221220\u00b0C. Concurrently, this unique structure reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation sheath, significantly reducing the water coordination number from 3.65 to 2.62, which effectively suppresses water\u2010induced parasitic reactions. Coupled with robust in situ interfacial engineering, the assembled battery exhibits a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability (97.0% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121) over a wide temperature range of 80\u00b0C (\u221220\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C). This work not only provides a high\u2010performance electrolyte for practical zinc batteries but also establishes an innovative design paradigm for resolving property conflicts in advanced functional materials.",
