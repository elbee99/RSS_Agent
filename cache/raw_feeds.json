    "content": "New insights into materials with differentiated pore structures are synthesized through precursor purification to investigate the rate\u2010performance failure mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHard carbons are considered to be the most promising anode materials for sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) because of their low cost and high sodium storage performance. However, the inadequate rate performance of hard carbon remains a critical bottleneck hindering high\u2010power applications of SIBs. Herein, we elucidate the key structural descriptors underlying the rate\u2010performance failure mechanism by constructing hard carbon with tailored microstructures, achieved via precise regulation of precursor composition. It is worth noting that the hard carbons engineered with the aforementioned differentiated structural design exhibit similar thermodynamic behaviors for sodium storage, but markedly different kinetic properties. At a current density of 2 A g\u22121, the reversible capacity of ABP\u2010L\u20101400 is 304.6 mAh g\u22121, which is 1.24 times of ABP\u2010H\u20101400. Systematic characterization reveals that the kinetic difference is primarily attributable to variations in low\u2010plateau capacity, with key influencing factors identified through in\u2010depth analysis as the uniform organic/inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase and the micro\u2010open pore structure. Additionally, practical applications can be extended to high\u2010power Prussian blue//hard carbon cylindrical cells, demonstrating a capacity of 702.2 mAh at 5 C. This work provides guidance for the design of advanced fast\u2010charging SIBs.",

The electrode achieves remarkable OER performance and durability, highlighting a practical pathway toward electronic structure\u2010engineered catalysts for large\u2010scale alkaline water electrolysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe sluggish kinetics of the multiple\u2010electron/proton oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a major bottleneck for alkaline water electrolysis. Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts is thus crucial for developing OER electrodes with superior activity and durability. Herein, we report a simple two\u2010step strategy to construct a magnetic free\u2010standing FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode, in which Fe doping effectively tailors the electronic spin structure of metal active sites, leading to remarkable OER activity. Specifically, the FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode delivers a low overpotential of 278 mV at 100 mA cm\u22122 and a small Tafel slope of 47.0 mV dec\u22121 in 1.0 m KOH. Remarkably, it maintains stable operation for over 900\u00a0h at 5000 A m\u22122 under high\u2010temperature and concentrated alkaline conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability and practical feasibility for industrial water electrolysis. Such superior performance originates from the high\u2010spin state of in situ formed metal (oxy)hydroxide active phase, which synergistically optimizes the adsorption\u2010desorption balance and electron transfer processes. This work offers a mechanistic investigation for regulating electronic spin structures via a doping strategy, paving the way for electronic\u2010engineered free\u2010standing electrodes toward industrial water electrolysis.",

This approach enables the first scalable 30 x 30 cm2 semi\u2010transparent solar module, highlighting its potential for building\u2010integrated and indoor photovoltaics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBalancing transparency and efficiency remains a key challenge for semi\u2010transparent perovskite solar cells (ST\u2010PSCs), restricting their application in building\u2010integrated photovoltaics and indoor electronics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy combining optical modelling, transparent electrode engineering, and molecular passivation to overcome this transparency\u2010efficiency trade\u2010off. Guided by transfer matrix simulations, a 1.7 eV FAMA\u2010based perovskite layer with a thickness of \u223c185 nm was integrated with an optimized MoO3/Au/MoO3 top electrode (59.9% transmittance).

Consequently, the champion ST\u2010PSC delivers 13.78% power conversion efficiency (PCE), 31.1% average visible transmittance (AVT), and a high light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.29%. Notably, this study demonstrates for the first time efficient indoor operation of ST\u2010PSCs, achieving 22.41% indoor PCE (iPCE) under 1000 lux LED illumination, and further realizes the first scalable 30 \u00d7 30\u00a0cm2 semi\u2010transparent module retaining 8.2% (7.4%) PCE under 1 sun (0.2 sun). The unencapsulated ST\u2010PSCs retain 79.6% of initial PCE after 268 h of continuous standard light soaking.

While hydrogen is widely promoted, its low volumetric energy density, complex storage requirements, and limited infrastructure readiness raise questions about scalability. This Perspective paper argues that aluminum deserves attention as a strategic energy carrier. With an exceptionally high volumetric energy density, global availability, and full recyclability, aluminum offers unique advantages for seasonal storage and sector coupling. We highlight the promising high\u2010temperature aluminum\u2013steam oxidation pathway, which produces both heat and hydrogen alongside \u03b3\u2010Al2O3, directly recyclable in decarbonized smelting processes. Beyond technical feasibility, we discuss system\u2010level opportunities, from coupling aluminum\u2010based storage with renewable\u2010powered smelting plants to enabling multi\u2010service energy hubs for electricity and mobility. Preliminary techno\u2010economic assessments show that aluminum\u2010based hybrid cycles can achieve round\u2010trip efficiencies of 30\u201336% in power\u2010to\u2010power applications and competitive levelized costs for electricity and hydrogen production in the power\u2010to\u2010X framework. Moreover, key performance indexes show aluminum\u2010based hydrogen aboveground storage can reach densities exceeding Clean Hydrogen targets by a factor of seven, with competitive CAPEX and OPEX values. These results highlight aluminum's potential to complement or outperform hydrogen in enabling reliable, high\u2010density, and fully recyclable energy storage within decarbonized energy systems.",

The resulting anode sustains industrial\u2010level OER at 2.0 A cm\u22122 for 4,000 h in 1.0 M KOH and efficiently drives AEM water electrolysis in strongly alkaline freshwater and natural seawater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh\u2212valent transition\u2212metal (oxy)hydroxides commonly demonstrated high intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrochemical self\u2212reconstruction. However, this evolution inevitably compromises structural integrity and long\u2212term durability at industrial current densities (>1 A cm\u22122). Here, we propose a sequential\u2212engineering strategy that separates catalytic\u2212site activation from surface reconstruction through the preconfiguring of a ligand\u2212hole\u2212rich (oxy)hydroxide. Combined structural and electrochemical analyses confirm that Fe3+ oxidizes L\u2212cysteine into a moderated sulfur donor, enabling precise S incorporation (avoiding sulfides, e.g., Ni3S2), along with Fe\u2212O\u2212Ni inductive polarization, biasing Ni2+ toward NiIII. In parallel, the preconfigured high NiIII strengthens Ni\u2500O covalency, while sulfur incorporation introduces ligand holes to O\u22122p band, thereby rendering lattice oxygen electrophilic. This pre\u2212establishing framework allows lattice\u2212oxygen to precede oxidation at Ni sites, affecting a kinetic decoupling that underpins durability. Consequently, the S\u2212NiFeOOH delivers overpotentials of 182 mV and 214 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively, while sustaining over 4000 hours of continuous operation at 2.0 A cm\u22122. In an anion\u2212exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it achieves 1 A cm\u22122 at 1.67 V (freshwater) and 1.74 V (seawater) and maintains stable performance beyond 3,500 hours at 1.0 A cm\u22122, underscoring its promise for large\u2212scale green hydrogen production.",

This review offers mechanistic insights into imperfectly matched Si/Gr hybrid anodes, elucidating heterogeneous lithiation behavior and interfacial failure pathways, and thereby informing the design of durable, high\u2010energy\u2013density lithium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSilicon/graphite (Si/Gr) anodes, integrating Si's ultrahigh specific capacity with Gr's structural stability and electrical conductivity, have emerged as the most promising high\u2010capacity systems for next\u2010generation lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). The synergy between Si and Gr enables a balance between energy density, cycling stability, and manufacturability, already demonstrated in commercial cells.

Although Gr can alleviate stress and maintain conductivity, mismatched electrochemical kinetics and mechanical properties between Si and Gr lead to heterogeneous lithiation and complex interfacial evolution, posing major engineering challenges. This review highlights recent advances in the mechanistic understanding and engineering optimization of Si/Gr anodes, emphasizing failure modes originating from both individual component degradation and interfacial coupling. The roles of advanced characterization and multiscale modeling in revealing volume effects and interfacial dynamics are discussed. Building on these insights, optimization strategies such as nanoscale structuring, interfacial engineering, buffered conductive frameworks, gradient architectures, electrode design, and pre\u2010lithiation are summarized.

    "content": "To overcome the thermodynamic instability and phase degradation of \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3, we employed a bimolecular coanchoring strategy based on 4\u2010[3\u2010(trifluoromethyl)\u20103H\u2010diazirin\u20103\u2010yl]benzoic acid and 2\u2010benzamidinyl\u20105\u2010guanidinopentanoic acid. This approach constructs a multiscale hydrogen\u2010bond network that simultaneously stabilizes FA\u207a and Pb2\u207a sites, enabling an improvement in perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 26.07% and exceptional thermal and photostability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nRecent advances in formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) solar cells have significantly improved their photoelectric conversion efficiency, positioning them as a leading candidate in third\u2010generation photovoltaics. However, their thermodynamic metastability\u2014driven by phase transitions from photoactive \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 to inactive \u03b4\u2010FAPbI3\u2014causes efficiency decay, hindering long\u2010term stability and industrialization. This study introduces a bimolecular synergistic anchoring strategy to address these challenges: a multiscale molecular interlocking network is constructed using 4\u2010[3\u2010(trifluoromethyl)\u20103H\u2010diazirin\u20103\u2010yl]benzoic acid (HDA) and 2\u2010benzamidinyl\u20105\u2010guanidinopentanoic acid (GS). HDA stabilizes formamidinium iodide (FAI) via carbene reactions, suppressing FA\u207a thermal escape, while GS binds under\u2010coordinated Pb2\u207a through its high dipole moment, minimizing lead leakage. Leveraging structural homology, these dual passivators synergistically stabilize A\u2010site (FA\u207a) and B\u2010site (Pb2\u207a) ions, forming a hydrogen\u2010bond network that optimizes crystal growth and enhances \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 phase stability and photothermal resilience. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) optimized with HDA\u2010GS achieve a record power conversion efficiency of 26.07%, along with exceptional operational stability: unencapsulated devices retain 95% of initial efficiency after 1300\u00a0h at 85\u00b0C under nitrogen (thermal stability) and 91% after 1500\u00a0h of continuous light exposure (light stability). This work demonstrates that a multi\u2010scale molecular interlocking network effectively overcomes perovskite inherent instability, offering a scalable pathway to high\u2010performance, durable PSCs.",

    "content": "This review comprehensively discusses the background and strategies for developing efficient and stretchable perovskite optoelectronics. This review covers an overview of features associated with mechanical deformation and characterization and various strategies utilized for other stretchable perovskite\u2010based optoelectronics. In addition, this review provides a research trend and suggest several issues and viewpoints about stretchable perovskite optoelectronics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAdvancing free\u2010form\u2010factor electronics is essential to broaden their applicability of electronics. In this regard, the development of stretchable semiconductors and their systems that offer both excellent stretchability with outstanding optoelectronic properties is imperative. Among various optoelectronic material candidates, metal\u2010halide perovskite has emerged as the most promising semiconductors owing to their high charge mobility, long exciton diffusion length and tunable bandgap. However, compared to stretchable organic\u2010based devices, stretchable perovskite devices have been rarely investigated because of perovskites\u2019 inherently low mechanical stretchability. In this regard, to develop stretchable perovskite optoelectronics, identifying the fundamental determinants of their low mechanical deformability and establishing of strategies to overcome these limitations are crucial. In this context, this paper presents the first in\u2010depth overview of stretchability characteristics of perovskite\u2010based optoelectronic device, highlighting key strategies for realizing next\u2010generation stretchable platforms from material and geometric perspectives. In detail, background on mechanical deformation behaviors of stretchable devices is provided. Subsequently, we examine reported studies on stretchable perovskite optoelectronic devices according to their materials and device structures. Finally, current challenges and important issues that remain unresolved but must be addressed to enable meaningful progress are discussed.",

    "content": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of vacuum\u2010based fabrication strategies for perovskite solar cells, with particular emphasis on precursor sublimability, stoichiometry control, and sublayer\u2010guided crystallization. By drawing direct comparisons with industrial organic light\u2010emitting diode (OLED) manufacturing, we emphasize both the opportunities and the remaining challenges associated with scalable, uniform multilayer device integration and commercialization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly advanced as a promising photovoltaic technology, achieving certified efficiencies exceeding 27% for single\u2010junction and 34% for tandem configurations. However, commercialization is hindered by solution\u2010based fabrication challenges, including solvent toxicity, interlayer damage, and poor large\u2010area uniformity. This review examines vacuum\u2010based dry processing as a scalable alternative, drawing parallels with the successful commercialization of organic light\u2010emitting diodes (OLEDs) via vacuum methods. We systematically analyzes dry fabrication of perovskite absorbers, classified by organic\u2010, inorganic\u2010, and hybrid\u2010 cations; charge transport layers, categorized by hole and electron transport layers with organic, inorganic, and hybrid variants; and fully dry\u2010processed PSCs. Key frameworks include precursor evaporability criteria, in situ stoichiometry control, and sublayer\u2010templated crystallization for uniform films and stable stacks. Extensive survey tables highlight photovoltaics in terms of their dry\u2010process methodologies used and resulting performances. This work concludes that by leveraging the multilayer precision and patterning expertise of OLEDs, dry\u2010processed PSCs offer enhanced reproducibility, environmental safety, and industrial viability, positioning them to overcome current bottlenecks toward widespread deployment.",

    "content": "A machine learning interatomic potential is introduced that enables rapid prediction of sodium\u2010ion conductivity in a wide range of glass electrolytes across 1,303 compositions. The study demonstrates how anion chemistry, particularly sulphides and halides, governs ion mobility, and identifies structural descriptors linked to ionic conductivity. The findings offer a data\u2010driven approach to designing high\u2010performance glassy solid electrolytes for batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGlass materials are promising candidates as solid electrolytes for batteries. However, the atomistic origins of variations in ionic conductivity with composition remain poorly understood. A key challenge in computationally designing high\u2010performance glass electrolytes is the absence of an efficient general interatomic potential, particularly for mixed\u2010anion systems, such as combinations of oxides, sulphides, and halides. To address these limitations, a machine learning interatomic potential for glass electrolytes is introduced, based on the atomic cluster expansion descriptor, covering common network formers, modifiers, and anions. Excellent agreement with experimental structure and property data across a wide range of glass compositions is observed. While the potential is broadly applicable to, e.g., lithium\u2010ion conductivity, focus is here on the influence of glass composition on sodium\u2010ion conductivity given the emerging importance of these conductors. By screening the diffusivity of 1,303 glass compositions, the presence of anion species, such as sulphides and halides, is found to have a large positive influence on diffusivity, enabling prediction of highly conductive glasses with mixed anions. Diffusivity and ionic conductivity are found to be highly correlated with a set of descriptors, such as the average atomic volume. This work thus helps to accelerate predictive modelling and broader understanding of conductivity in glass electrolytes.",

    "content": "A vacuum\u2010filtration method using polymer\u2010dopant suspensions enables rapid fabrication of tens\u2010of\u2010micrometers\u2010thick, uniformly doped polymer films. Excess dopants and short\u2010conjugated polymer chains are effectively removed during filtration, reducing structural and energetic disorder. These films are integrated into fingertip\u2010sized thermoelectric generators that operate electronic devices using body heat, achieving a record areal power density and offering a new, scalable leg fabrication strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nOptimization of leg dimensions, including thickness, is essential for maximizing output powers of thermoelectric (TE) generators. However, fabricating thick and uniform active films with conjugated polymers remains challenging, as doping processes are limited either by reduced solubility in polymer\u2010dopant blend solutions or by a trade\u2010off between dopant diffusion and doping stability. Here, a vacuum filtration method is introduced to fabricate tens\u2010of\u2010micrometers\u2010thick films within a few seconds by selectively collecting large, doped polymer particles from a polymer\u2010dopant suspension. The polymer particles form smooth, thick, uniformly doped, and highly flexible TE films via interparticle coalescence, while the short\u2010conjugated polymers and inactive dopants are effectively removed during filtration, thereby greatly enhancing the TE performance. The \u224860\u2010\u00b5m\u2010thick doped polymer films are integrated to fabricate fingertip\u2010sized TE generators, which exhibit high output powers up to 2.00 \u00b5W at \u0394T = 15.2 K, yielding a record\u2010high normalized areal power density (209 \u00b5W m\u22122 K\u22122) and enabling successful electronic device operations using body heat. It is believed that the vacuum filtration method offers a new experimental protocol for fabricating organic TE generators as well as for gaining deep insights into the effects of solution\u2010state doping on the electrical and structural properties of conjugated polymers.",
