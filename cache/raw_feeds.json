A notable challenge persists in realizing multistate spintronic devices with electrical control at nanoscale. Here, we propose a breakthrough strategy for achieving bias-controlled giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for multistate memory applications. Our design uses two-dimensional (2D) half-metals hosting strongly localized spin states (LSSs) at the Fermi level as two ferromagnet layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Multiple memory states emerge from bias-driven alignment/misalignment of LSSs on two sides, generating sudden tunneling pathway changes and distinguishable TMR. First-principles quantum transport simulations on MTJs based on 2D VCl\n    <sub>\n     3\n    </sub>\n    and FeCl\n    <sub>\n     2\n    </sub>\n    reveal unprecedented bias-controlled and widely modulable TMR ratios spanning \u2212194 to 2677% and\u00a0\u2212130 to 37,424%, respectively, accompanied by rare polarity switch capabilities. Our work opens a promising route for realizing electrical control of multistate spintronics.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

    "content": "Abstract\nChanges in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are believed to have affected the cycling of carbon isotopes \u03b413C $\\left({\\delta }^{13}C\\right)$ in both the ocean and the atmosphere. However, understanding how AMOC changes \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) distributions in the ocean is limited, since models do not typically decompose the various processes that affect \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$. Here, a new decomposition is applied to idealized simulations of an AMOC collapse, both for glacial and preindustrial conditions. The decomposition explicitly calculates the preformed and regenerated components of \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ and separates between physical and biological effects. An AMOC collapse leads to a large and rapid decrease in \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the North Atlantic, which is due to, in about equal parts, accumulation of remineralized organic matter and changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$, both in glacial and preindustrial simulations. In the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ increases by a smaller magnitude. This increase is dominated by changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the glacial simulation and remineralized \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the preindustrial simulation. An extensive evaluation of the decomposition shows that its errors are small in most cases, especially for large basin\u2010wide changes, whereas for small, local or global changes errors can be substantial. In contrast, approximations of the remineralized component based on Apparent Oxygen Utilization have large errors in most cases and are generally unreliable because they include contributions from oxygen disequilibrium."

Notwithstanding a partial synchronicity with the COVID-19 pandemic, this rapid global dissemination of more virulent GAS lineages has been promptly detected, as well as the molecular shifts underlying the observed changes in clinical patterns. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based genomic epidemiology allowed us to gain relevant insights into this upsurge as it was happening. This review integrates the canonical research publication-based approach with genomic data and metadata and identifies a subset of genomic clusters playing a major role in invasive GAS (iGAS) infections worldwide, which were named as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Global Pathogenic Lineages</span> (GPLs). The four GPLs broadly coincide with five sequence types (STs): GPL1 with ST28, GPL2 with ST15 and ST315, GPL3 with ST52, and GPL4 with ST39. While non-GPLs clusters maintain a baseline reservoir of antimicrobial\u2010resistance and virulence genes, GPLs show varying but noteworthy resistance profiles and are frequent causes of iGAS. The integration of WGS into routine diagnostics procedures is a forthcoming improvement, aimed not only at informing tailored therapy and implementing infection control strategies, but also to perform continuous surveillance. Ongoing WGS in clinical microbiology, as a matter of fact, will provide unparalleled insights into lineage emergence, transmission dynamics, and the geographic clustering of virulence and resistance determinants.</span>"

These materials incorporate living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, or algae, to enable unique functions like self-assembly, actuation, and dynamic interaction. By utilizing (micro)biological systems in material design, ELMs promise to transform industries including healthcare, construction, and agriculture. In the early phase of ELM technology development, researchers implemented a single living strain in an already established user material. However, the complexity and potential of these materials is limited by the abilities of this single strain. Even though synthetic biology brings the opportunity to add a range of nonnative bioactivities to these cells and thus the material, the increasing metabolic burden upon implementation of multiple nonnative pathways limits the capacity of a single strain. Furthermore, higher organisms and nonstandard hosts are often desired in material settings for their native physical or metabolic advantages. However these are not always straightforward to further engineer. Thus, the use of multiple, specialized strains broadens the functionalities and thus the applicability of ELMs. Multistrain ELMs are a brand-new technology, with many promising applications.</span>"

SRB\u2010specific lipids showed eightfold higher DI13C\u2010assimilation than ANME lipids, suggesting SRB directly assimilate DIC, while ANME assimilate an alternative carbon source, potentially provided by SRBs.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn cold seeps, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate\u2010reducing bacteria (SRB) oxidise methane to inorganic carbon (IC) coupled to sulphate reduction. While catabolic pathways are well resolved, carbon flow into biomass as well as the functional roles of lipid biomarkers remain unclear. We conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid\u2010SIP) experiments with Astoria Canyon sediments dominated by ANME\u20102/SRB consortia and incubated samples with either 13C\u2010labelled methane (13CH4) or dissolved IC (DI13C). Lipid\u2010specific \u03b413C analysis showed higher 13C incorporation from DI13C than from 13CH4. After 30\u2009days, \u03b413C values were up to +417\u2030 in SRB\u2010specific fatty acids (e.g., C16:1\u03c95c, cyC17:0\u03c95,6) and +126\u2030 in ANME\u20102\u2010specific isoprenoid lipids (e.g., archaeol, crocetane). Based on these values, we calculated carbon assimilation rates and found that both partners primarily assimilate IC. Remarkably, IC assimilation in SRB lipids was eight times higher than in ANME lipids, suggesting that ANME may use additional yet\u2010to\u2010be\u2010identified carbon sources, potentially produced by their partner SRB. By examining the stepwise 13C\u2010enrichment of ANME\u2010 and SRB\u2010derived lipids, we further delineate biosynthetic pathways for archaeal and bacterial diether lipid formation and highlight crocetane as a bilayer\u2010modulating isoprenoid hydrocarbon potentially affecting membrane fluidity and proton permeability."

    "link": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JG009072?af=R",
    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the balance between denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in riparian systems is essential for managing watershed nitrogen (N) budgets and evaluating restoration practices. This balance is influenced by several factors including concentrations and ratio of various organic and inorganic electron donors (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Fe2+) to acceptor (NO3\u2212). In riparian sediments, these factors can change rapidly over space and time, complicating measurement and quantification. We used a PFLOTRAN batch reactor model calibrated to laboratory microcosm experiments where the denitrification and DNRA rates in riparian sediments were measured using 15N stable isotopes. Although DOC/NO3\u2212 ratios influenced the relative proportions of denitrification and DNRA, the processes were also affected by elemental concentrations. For a starting DOC concentration of 0.12\u00a0mgL\u22121, DNRA exceeded denitrification at DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a06; however, this shift was not observed within a range of DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a030 at higher DOC concentration of 12\u00a0mgL\u22121. Heterotrophic pathways dominated NO3\u2010N reduction with smaller contribution from autotrophic pathways. These findings suggest that although heterotrophic pathways are important in carbon\u2010rich sediments, autotrophic pathways can be significant in carbon\u2010depleted conditions in the presence of inorganic electron donors such as Fe2+. Our simulations also highlighted key challenges with constraining model rate constants and parameters and the need for site specific calibrations. This work highlights the value of process\u2010based modeling in quantifying denitrification\u2010DNRA partitioning and the variable controls of electron donors and acceptors. Such simulations could be extended to riparian buffers to determine if they are effective management sinks for N mitigation."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study studies the predictability of the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) for the eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) over the past 142\u00a0years from 1880\u20132021 by exploring its fastest error growth. This is implemented by applying the climate\u2010relevant singular vector (CSV) analysis onto a tropical intermediate coupled model. Emphasis places on identifying the optimal perturbation that can result in the fastest prediction error growth of the EIO SSTA. It is found that, with the 6\u2010month lead prediction, the spatial pattern of the optimal initial perturbations is characterized by a negative SSTA pole with the diverged surface wind in the southern Indian Ocean and a positive SSTA pole with the converged surface wind in the eastern Pacific. The growth rate of optimal initial perturbation, as measured by the leading singular value, exhibits significant interannual variation consistent with the variation of the SSTA in EIO. Specifically, when the SSTA in the EIO is colder, the prediction error grows more rapidly, and conversely, when the SSTA is warmer, the error grows more slowly. The results of the dynamical analysis show that a cold SSTA background strengthens Ekman feedback through both atmospheric and oceanic responses, leading to faster growth of prediction errors. This study enhances our understanding to the predictability in the Indian Ocean, in particular the role of EIO in the Indian Ocean dipole predictability."

    "content": "Abstract\nSatellite\u2010derived sea ice products and ice model simulations are analyzed in the Bering Sea during the winters of 2018\u20132019, featuring historically low sea ice coverage on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf, and 2019\u20132020, when ice conditions were close to average. Hindcast simulations are conducted using the Community sea Ice CodE (CICE) as a standalone regional ice model forced with ERA5 atmospheric fields and oceanic fields derived from realizations of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) internally coupled with its own ice model component. CICE is able to predict the observed seasonal variability in ice concentration and ice thickness provided that ocean mixed layer temperature and salinity are strongly nudged toward an accurate ocean state. Ice mass balance analysis shows that sustained periods of southerly wind during the 2018\u201319 season led to increased melting and a larger ice export into the Arctic when compared to 2019\u201320. More ice was produced in 2018\u201319, the season with lower sea ice areal extent, offset by larger melting and transport out of the domain. The volume of ice exported to the Russian shelf and basin is comparable to the net transport through the Bering Strait. The consistency between the model and satellite products demonstrates that the representation of sea ice thermodynamic and dynamic models present in CICE are adequate for representing key physical processes driving sea ice variability in this region during both low and normal ice coverage years."

    "content": "Abstract\nInternal waves and geostrophic motions contribute to sea surface height (SSH) variability at scales order 100\u00a0km and smaller. Although geostrophic motions have a well\u2010defined contribution in SSH, the internal wave contribution is complex and small enough to be confounded with noise. This has impeded attempts to separate internal wave effects from geostrophic signals in SSH measurements. Shipboard acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) data combined with along\u2010track satellite altimetry are used to estimate the internal\u2010wave component of the SSH wavenumber spectrum in the southeast tropical Pacific. A modified wave\u2010vortex kinetic energy (KE) decomposition in combination with linear wave theory and the Garrett\u2010Munk model are used to convert the ADCP\u2010inferred wave KE spectrum into an SSH spectrum representative of the wave continuum. The continuum component explains the SSH spectral slope (\u223c\u22122) $(\\sim -2)$ of this area. The full SSH spectrum is reconstructed as the sum of the contributions from the internal wave continuum, the geostrophically balanced (\u201cvortex\u201d) component, internal tides, and altimeter noise. The SSH spectra of internal tides and altimeter noise are derived from models. The reconstruction recovers 80% of the observed variance at large scales and 60% within the semidiurnal internal tide band. The residual between this reconstruction and the altimetry\u2010derived spectrum is interpreted as nonstationary internal tidal energy. The nonstationary tide is more energetic than suggested by previous altimeter\u2010based estimates, highlighting the challenge of extracting geostrophic signals from SSH."

Yet, the fine\u2010scale structure, variability, and long\u2010term evolution of its water masses and nutrient concentrations remain poorly characterized. Here, we combine almost two decades of high\u2010resolution hydrographic and biogeochemical data (2006\u20132024) to resolve the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient availability and water mass (WM) properties across this key arctic gateway. Using unsupervised clustering and tracer\u2010based diagnostics, we identify three dominant WM regimes shaped by Arctic and Atlantic influences, glacial inputs, and internal mixing. Our analysis reveals net freshening and nutrient shifts across all major water masses, including a doubling of nutrient concentrations in the arctic upper halocline as well as significant freshening of Polar Mode Water and Baffin Bay Polar Water properties. This multidecadal analysis provides crucial insights into the complex drivers of hydrographic and nutrient changes, enhancing our ability to predict how Arctic productivity will evolve."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe lucinid clam Lucinoma capensis thrives at the oxygen minimum zone margins in the Benguela Upwelling System, where oxygen levels fluctuate dramatically. Understanding its adaptation to such extreme conditions provides key insights into survival strategies under fluctuating oxygen availability. We investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of L. capensis under normoxia, hypoxia, and recovery, focusing on the gills and digestive gland. Our findings highlight distinct organ\u2010specific responses, with the gills showing strong transcriptional changes to oxygen fluctuations, in contrast to the more stable profile observed in the digestive gland. Under hypoxic conditions, the gills exhibited coordinated downregulation of protein synthesis, transposable element activity, and immune function, suggesting a tightly regulated energy conservation strategy and mechanisms to preserve symbiont stability and genomic integrity. Activation of prokaryotic metabolism in the gills supports the symbionts' role in host energy acquisition and sulfide detoxification during hypoxia. In contrast, the digestive gland showed minimal transcriptional shifts during anoxia, with upregulation of pathways supporting structural maintenance. Upon reoxygenation, the gills displayed an active and asymmetric recovery, characterised by rapid restoration of protein synthesis and gradual normalisation of protein degradation and immune functions. Despite significant transcriptomic changes, the metabolome remained largely stable, reflecting L. capensis's resilience to oxygen fluctuations. However, an overshoot in TCA cycle intermediates and derepression of previously downregulated pathways indicate that reoxygenation involves active metabolic reprogramming, not merely a return to baseline. This study highlights the specialised tissue responses and symbiotic contributions that enable L. capensis to thrive in one of the ocean's most challenging environments."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe marine environment comprises vast regions without physical barriers to movement, making the understanding of population isolation and the evolution of diversity challenging. This is especially the case for highly mobile marine species. Here we investigate populations of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) across the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic using high\u2010resolution genomic markers (RADseq) and stable isotope analyses to better understand the evolution of population structure in this system. High\u2010resolution genomic data and broad geographic sampling revealed patterns of structure not previously identified, and integration with stable isotope data suggests that prey choice varies across this region. Unexpected patterns included genetic and isotopic similarity between the North Atlantic and the region around Sicily (but not including the medially located Gulf of C\u00e1diz and surrounding regions). The regional habitat within and beyond the Mediterranean Sea is structured with ocean frontal systems including thermal and halocline transitions, several of which show alignment with genetic transitions within our data. Our data help to distinguish among possible drivers of population differentiation for a marine predator that has the potential for long\u2010distance dispersion."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nPast population dynamics during the Pleistocene ice age and the Holocene era have profoundly influenced the genetic structure and diversity of species. Environmental heterogeneity has further shaped local and regional adaptive variation. Here, we ask how historical processes have led to the current genetic diversity of a key North American species across its vast natural range and what genomic signatures indicate regional adaptive divergence and local adaptation. We used sequencing data from 1903 Populus tremuloides Michx. (quaking aspen) trees to assess historical population dynamics and identify genotype \u2013environment associations within and among the species' major genetic lineages. The two northern and western North American aspen lineages exhibited historical population expansion patterns, while the southernmost lineage experienced a historical bottleneck consistent with past glacial oscillations. We found that the earliest split between genetic lineages of P. tremuloides occurred in the southern part of its distribution range. We further identified larger blocks of adaptive SNPs within separate genomic sequence regions on chromosomes 2 and 8 that may exhibit suppressed genetic recombination, contributing to the maintenance of regional and local adaptation in the species. Our study provides key insights into the evolutionary processes affecting adaptive genetic variation and phylogeography at a broad continental and regional scale, with implications for predicting species' responses to future climate change."

Unfortunately, the number of sustainable practices needed to support production, ecosystem services and land conservation remains virtually unknown. We compiled a database of 1570 observations from 349 sites in 57 countries to assess how the number of sustainable practices influences multiple ecosystem services. Our findings reveal that a high number of sustainable practices is crucial for enhancing agroecosystem services such as soil carbon storage, fertility and microbial habitat while supporting yield. Sustainable practices such as crop rotation, limited tillage and incorporation of crop residues were especially important. North America, Eastern Europe and China were particularly dependent on the use of multiple sustainable practices to maintain ecosystem services. Findings underscore the need for integrative strategies employing multiple sustainable practices for mitigating global change, ensuring food security and sustaining ecosystems."

    "content": "<p>by Xitong Luo, Lei Zhang, Yafeng Pan</p>\n\nWe often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence\u2014from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence\u2014has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human communications. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees\u2019 opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees\u2019 opinions (Studies 1 & 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 & 4). Our findings reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees\u2019 opinions (we refer to this as the <i>alignment bias</i>) (Study 1). This tendency, which reflects normative conformity, persists even when advisors were directly incentivized to provide accurate advice (Study 2). As feedback is introduced, advisors\u2019 behavior shifts in ways best captured by a reinforcement learning model, suggesting that advisees\u2019 feedback drives adaptations in advice giving that maximize acceptance and minimize rejection (Study 3). This adaptation persisted even when acceptance is rare, as bolstered by the model-based evidence (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors\u2019 susceptibility to the consequence of giving advice, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters."

Here, we report the role of microtubule (MT) nanotubes in rendering the <i>Drosophila</i> micropyle functional, a structure essential for sperm entry during fertilization. Our study highlights that MT-nanotubes emanate from the apical end of the specialized epithelial cells called the polar cells in late oogenesis, forming a narrow channel through the eggshell. Utilizing a combination of fly genetics, live cell imaging, and tissue immunochemistry, our research elucidates the structural and functional characteristics of the polar cell nanotube. We show that tubulin is vital for the formation of these nanotubes, which are enriched in the lateral membrane marker, Fasciclin III. Moreover, the overall polarity of the migrating cell cluster is critical for the successful development of the micropyle. Notably, both lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking within the polar cells are essential for the opening of the vitelline layer, further facilitating the micropyle\u2019s role in fertilization."

Here we found that Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), a neuron-specific protein in the brain, played an important role in dictating synaptic NMDAR subunit composition in spinal cord somatostatin-positive (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neuron, a key component in the spinal circuit transmitting mechanical pain in mice. Our data showed that the protein level of RIN1 was low early after birth, which progressively increased with synapse maturation and promoted the switch from synaptic GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs. In adult mice, the nerve injury-induced pathological pain paralleled a significant increase of RIN1 protein in spinal SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons, which drove a new round of GluN2B-to-GluN2A switching at mature synapses. Our data revealed the molecular mechanisms by which RIN1 differentially regulated the synaptic trafficking of GluN2B and GluN2A receptors, and implied that RIN1-mediated pathological switch of NMDAR subunit composition strikingly altered the analgesic efficacy of distinct NMDAR subunit antagonists with the development of neuropathic pain."

Here, we show that supplementation of multiple low-dose nutrients\u2014an important environmental factor contributing to ASD\u2014can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in mice. First, we used <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, a well-established model of ASD, to investigate the effect of nutrient cocktails containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine, all of which are known to regulate synapse formation and activity. Supplementation of nutrient cocktails for 7 days altered total proteomes by increasing synapse-related proteins. Our results further reveal that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Nutrient supplementation normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA neurons in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement mixtures containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in <i>Nf1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> and <i>Cttnbp2</i><sup>+/M120I</sup> mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models."

    "content": "Abstract\nVolatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)\u2014carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and carbon disulfide (CS2)\u2014play critical roles in atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, quantitative understanding of VSC exchange dynamics in coastal wetland ecosystems remains limited. Here, we quantified the sediment\u2010air fluxes of these VSCs across vegetated (Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda glauca) and unvegetated mudflat habitats via year\u2010round field observations in a temperate intertidal wetland. We found that S. alterniflora sediments exhibited net emissions of COS (4.61\u2009\u00b1\u20099.19\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), DMS (10.25\u2009\u00b1\u200912.35\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), and CS2 (5.77\u2009\u00b1\u20097.29\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), while S. glauca and mudflats exhibited variable sink\u2013source dynamics. VSC fluxes from S. alterniflora habitats significantly exceeded those from other zones due to high root sulfate and total sulfur contents, as well as microbial organisms and temperature\u2010dependent microbial activity related to sulfur metabolism. The DMS flux in S. alterniflora zones decreased by 33\u2013224% after ebb tide compared to before flooding, with principal component analysis identifying phase\u2010specific controls: pre\u2010flood fluxes were associated with porewater chemistry (pH, redox potential) and atmosphere (water content, pressure) coupling, while post\u2010ebb fluxes were governed by ionic gradients (conductivity) and residual moisture (water content). Tidal simulation experiments revealed the joint influences of illumination, water content, and anaerobic processes on VSC production, where anaerobic conditions suppressed DMS and CS2 formation but enhanced COS emission in the dark. These findings establish that coastal VSC fluxes are regulated by the interplay between macrophyte\u2010mediated sediment biogeochemistry and tidal pumping. This provides mechanistic insights into wetland sulfur cycle modeling."

    "content": "Mechanistic models are central to quantitative understanding and optimisation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture processes, but their utility is often restricted by parameter sets calibrated for specific cell lines, scales, or operating conditions. In this study, we present the application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to bioprocessing, introducing an ensemble-based framework for dual state and parameter estimation that enables mechanistic model adaptation across distinct systems. The EnKF recursively assimilates process measurements to update uncertain kinetic parameters and predict system states, allowing a model developed for one system to be transferred to a new one without reparametrisation and using only a single experimental dataset. The evolving parameter ensembles provide a time-resolved sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters have dominant influence under new process conditions and when their effects become significant. The framework was evaluated across six CHO cell experimental datasets differing in scale, cell line, temperature, and feeding strategy, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of system dynamics and progressive improvement in long-term predictions as new data became available. By maintaining full mechanistic transparency while flexibly adapting to new data, the EnKF offers a practical route for knowledge transfer across systems, strengthening the role of mechanistic modelling in data-informed bioprocess understanding and control."

    "content": "Tumor growth and resistance arise from the interplay between cell-cycle dysregulation and the spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). While spatial transcriptomics now enables molecular profiling of intact tissues, it captures only static molecular states, making it challenging to reconstruct dynamic processes such as proliferation. Here, we develop SpaceCycle, a computational framework that infers the continuous cell-cycle phase and associated oscillatory gene expression dynamics from spatial transcriptomic data. Using human melanoma, breast, and lung tumors, we map both discrete and continuous cell-cycle states across entire tissue sections to reveal how proliferative activity is spatially structured within the TME. We find that cycling and non-cycling cells form distinct spatial niches reflecting differences in vascularization, immune composition, and cellular density. Continuous-phase inference further exposes tumor-specific variations in cell cycle phase durations and uncovers oscillatory programs. Together, our results provide a spatiotemporal view of cell-cycle organization in human tumors and establish a general framework for detecting dynamic transcriptional programs and spatial proliferation patterns from static tissue data."

    "content": "Fine-tuned regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity is essential for accurate gene expression. A key layer of this regulation involves phosphorylation of Pol II's C-terminal domain (CTD), a repetitive heptapeptide tail that coordinates transcription and RNA-processing factors. The kinase P-TEFb plays a major role in this process, yet its precise phosphorylation mechanism remains unclear. Previous in vitro studies have suggested a distributive mode of action based largely on qualitative inspection of mass spectrometry data rather than quantitative analysis. Here, we use mathematical modeling of CTD phosphorylation to explore whether local context, such as neighboring phosphorylations or directional biases, affects P-TEFb activity on the CTD. Our results indicate that P-TEFb acts distributively but with pronounced local cooperativity: repeats adjacent to phosphorylated sites are modified at higher rates. We find no evidence for directional bias, although the limited positional resolution of the data precludes a definitive conclusion. These results identify local context as an important factor in P-TEFb-mediated CTD phosphorylation and establish a quantitative modeling framework for dissecting multi-site modification dynamics."

    "content": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) arises from coupled interactions between blood flow, tissue mechanics, and cellular signaling. Hemodynamic forces influence endothelial and interstitial cell behavior, while the resulting tissue remodeling alters valve motion and flow patterns. Capturing this two-way feedback requires models that integrate fluid-structure mechanics with biochemical regulation, yet such multiscale coupling remains technically challenging. Previous computational models have focused on isolated aspects of the disease: fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations reproduce valve deformation and flow, and systems biology (SB) models describe molecular signaling that drives fibrosis and calcification. However, without coupling, these approaches cannot predict how mechanical dysfunction initiates biochemical remodeling or how biochemical changes feed back on mechanics. Here, we present a multi-physics computational framework that couples three-dimensional FSI simulations of aortic valve dynamics with a mechanistic SB model of calcification signaling. The FSI module resolves pulsatile blood flow and leaflet deformation, yielding local wall shear stresses and tissue strains throughout the cardiac cycle. These mechanical quantities are used as inputs to the SB module, which represents key biochemical pathways governing inflammation, TGF-{beta}/SMAD signaling, and nitric-oxide (NO)--mediated inhibition within valvular cells. Simulations predict long-term calcification trajectories for valves of varying thickness, showing that fibrosis-induced stiffening lowers shear stress, reduces NO synthesis, and enhances TGF-{beta} activation, thereby accelerating calcification. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing future incorporation of additional pathways, as well as implementation of full two-way coupling between the FSI and SB models. By integrating physics-based hemodynamics with systems-level biochemistry, this study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a next-generation, multi-scale modeling platform for studying cardiovascular disease that unites blood flow dynamics and biochemical signaling."

To address the challenge of high-throughput screening in filamentous fungi, we developed methods to construct a genome-wide barcoded insertional mutant library in Trichoderma atroviride, a filamentous fungus widely used as a biocontrol agent against bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Our strategy leveraged randomly barcoded transfer DNA insertions from plasmid libraries containing hundreds of millions of unique DNA barcodes and a broad host-range drug resistance marker delivered via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into T. atroviride. By optimizing transformation conditions, we achieved up to 600 independent transformants per infection event, resulting in a library of over 31,000 mapped insertions disrupting 7,115 of the 11,828 predicted genes in the T. atroviride genome. This resource establishes a scalable platform for high-throughput functional genomics in filamentous fungi, enabling both fundamental investigations of fungal biology and engineering approaches toward improved medical applications, biotechnology, and sustainable agriculture."

    "content": "Classical microbiology has focused on directly suppressing pathogens using drugs, ignoring other harmless microbial species living alongside the pathogens. We now have a much better understanding of how species interact and affect one another's growth within microbial communities, for example through chemical production. Here we capitalize on this understanding to demonstrate how one can manipulate and control the strength of interactions between bacterial species, and combine this with antibiotics to fully suppress and eliminate pathogens. Using experiments and a mathematical model, we first show how Citrobacter freundii can reduce the environmental pH to enhance the effect of ampicillin on the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This negative interaction from C. freundii to P. aeruginosa can be strengthened by increasing glucose concentrations. Our proof-of-concept approach also worked against other pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a different commensal: Lactobacillus plantarum, a common probiotic species. Overall, we show that taking advantage of the community and chemical context in which microbes live can help to develop efficient strategies to control them. In the medical context, this approach can help to eliminate pathogens thereby reducing our reliance on antibiotics."

    "content": "Crawling motility is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells and requires a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, regulated adhesion, and spatially organized signalling pathways. Asgard archaea (phylum Promethearchaeota) which are considered the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes potentially encode these functions within their large set of eukaryotic signature proteins. The few cultivated members show a complex cell morphology, consisting of a central cell body from which several protrusions extend, filled with an actin-based cytoskeleton. Here, live cell microscopy of two organisms of the Loki- and Hodarchaea lineages showed that they dynamically and drastically change their cell shape on a minute time scale and grow and retract their extensive protrusions with a speed of 1.5 to 5.3 micron/min, respectively. After adhering to a glass surface, cells employ their protrusions to undergo active crawling motion. In the presence of selected actin inhibitors however, the observed dynamics were arrested, suggesting a central role of actin in these processes. The observed cellular plasticity and motility are unique features among prokaryotes and might have been crucial for the emergence of the first eukaryotic cells that are thought to have formed through the association of a member of the Promethearchaeota and an alphaproteobacterium, the ancestor of mitochondria."

We report that Plectosphaerella cucumerina is a core member of the Arabidopsis thaliana root microbiota displaying high pathogenic potential and multi-host colonization capabilities. Establishment of a Plectosphaerella reference culture collection, followed by whole-genome sequencing of 72 strains reveals subtle phenotypic and genotypic variation that associate with fungal phylogeny, but not host plant identity. Transcriptome profiling of a model P. cucumerina isolate in roots of multiple hosts identifies core and host-specific fungal processes linked to carbon catabolism and root cell wall deconstruction of the hosts. A fungal gene encoding a candidate Beta-1,3-glucanase (GH64) was identified as a key genetic factor driving infection and disease in plants that diverged 110 million years ago. The gene is enriched in plant-colonizing fungi and consistently functions as a disease determinant in the root pathogen Colletotrichum incanum. We conclude that diverse and tunable fungal repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes act as disease determinants and drive multi-host compatibility belowground."

    "content": "Despite microorganisms being primarily responsible for landfill material decomposition, limited characterization has been performed across both landfill depth and age. Here, we investigated the microbial communities and physicochemical parameters in two active and two closed landfill wells from surface to bottom, as well as fill dirt and leachate at a sanitary landfill near Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Amplicon community sequencing fungi, bacteria and archaea revealed distinct microbial community structures across landfill sites. The observed patterns of microbial community succession by depth and age mirror the known phases of the landfill life cycle. Younger surface samples were dominated by aerobic fungi, which transitioned to fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in older, deeper, layers. Simultaneously, high species richness was preserved across landfill ages, while reduced evenness at specific depths support spatial niche differentiation. In conjunction with the lack of trends found for physicochemical parameters by depth, this supports niche differentiation driven by the highly heterogenous waste inputs. This study provides the first comprehensive vertical profile of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across landfill depths and ages, highlighting the influence of these parameters on physicochemical factors and microbial distribution within landfills. These results have implications for improving landfill management, including renewable gas energy production, minimizing emissions, and increasing degradation rates."

    "content": "Picocyanobacteria from the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus thrive across the globe in aqueous environments, have relatively small genomes, and have growth dynamics regulated by both viral interactions and abiotic conditions, making them excellent model organisms for exploring host-pathogen coevolution. The Salish Sea, located in the Western coastal waters bordering the USA and Canada, is at the current northern boundary (defined by Prochlorococcus versus Synechococcus prevalence ratios) of the range of Prochlorococcus. Predictions suggest that this boundary will shift as warmer waters move northward, providing an excellent system to study host-pathogen dynamics and coevolution in a changing environmental context. In preparation for such studies, we developed and refined methods to sample and sequence cyanobacteria, cyanophages, and their abiotic environment. In addition to basic methodological questions focused on the physical sampling, filtering, viral precipitation, DNA extraction, and technical replicability, we explored how well our filtering and extraction protocols enrich for our main target, picocyanobacteria. The protocol described herein can successfully discriminate large-cell eukaryotic organisms, but size fractionation of picocyanobacteria appears to be affected by the presence of free DNA, multicellular structures, and abundant tycheposons. Our preferred final protocol at the conclusion of these experiments based on yield and processing time is presented. We recovered substantial Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and amoeba-like sequences in most samples, and preliminary exploration of relative taxon sequence read recoveries across locations, over time, and tidal conditions are also discussed. Approaches described here may be useful to other efforts such as harmful algal bloom monitoring, species isolation and enrichment, water quality assessments, anti-viral discovery, and understanding picocyanobacterial population changes over space and time."

    "content": "Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the mite-borne human disease scrub typhus. The species is characterised by having many strains that differ in their ability to cause disease in murine infection models and in human patients. The genomes of a diverse set of Orientia tsutsugamushi strains have recently been analysed in detail, revealing broadly similar gene content with genomes differing primarily in synteny and in the composition of a large arsenal of predicted secreted effector proteins. Given the similarity in gene content, here we asked whether the observed differences in virulence were driven by genome-wide differences in gene expression of bacterial genes, and differences in the ensuing response of infected host cells. To explore this, we carried out a dual RNA sequencing analysis of eight diverse strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi grown in cultured human endothelial cells. An overall analysis found no clear patterns in the bacterial or host gene expression patterns that correlate with the ability to cause disease. We found that all strains induce a strong type 1 interferon response in endothelial cells, but that within that broad response each strain has a unique fingerprint of induced genes likely leading to different disease outcomes when combined with a complex immune system in vivo. We compared expression levels of orthologous genes between different strains and identified some bacterial pathways with constant expression levels whilst others were more variable, leading to the identification of specific pathways under tight transcriptional control during cellular infection. Together our data show that inter-strain differences in virulence are not defined by expression levels of any one set of bacterial or host genes and also reveal insights into transcriptional regulation of different pathways in Orientia tsutsugamushi."

    "content": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-originspecific epigenetic mechanism with essential roles in placental development and fetal growth in mice, but its contribution to brain function and evolution remains unclear. Here, we investigated genomic imprinting in the ferret, a gyrencephalic mammal whose cortical architecture closely resembles that of humans rather than mice. Guided by human imprinting datasets, we screened 65 candidate genes in ferret brain and identified paternal expression of Adam23, maternal expression of Atp10a, and biallelic expression of genes including PXDC1, WRB and UBE3A. Adam23 showed paternal expression in ferret cortex, particularly in the occipital region, whereas it was biallelically expressed in mouse brain. In human SH-SY5Y cells, Adam23 was biallelic in undifferentiated cells but shifted toward monoallelic expression upon neuronal differentiation. CpG analysis of upstream islands indicated that Adam23 imprinting in ferrets is independent of promoter methylation, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism. Functional assays in Neuro-2aTG cells showed that Adam23 knockdown enhances neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression promotes cell proliferation. These findings identify Adam23 as a non-canonical imprinted gene whose dosage influences stem cell dynamics and neurite development, linking imprinting to the evolution of gyrencephalic cortical structures and highlighting the ferret as a valuable model for imprinting studies in higher-order brain function."

    "content": "The multidrug resistance (MDR) problem in Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is becoming increasingly severe, necessitating the development of novel antibacterial agents and strategies. In this study, seven Elaiophylin derivatives were isolated from Streptomyces sp. WS-30248, and the antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of the principal compound, Elaiophylin, against S. suis were systematically evaluated for the first time. Through comprehensive approaches including in vitro efficacy assays, biofilm inhibition and eradication tests, bacterial membrane integrity analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level detection, and a mouse infection model, Elaiophylin was found to exhibit significant antibacterial activity against multiple clinically MDR S. suis strains. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 0.5 g/mL, and complete bactericidal activity was achieved within 24 hours at 4xMIC. The compound effectively inhibited and eradicated bacterial biofilms, directly killing embedded cells within the biofilm matrix. Mechanistic studies revealed that Elaiophylin functions through multiple synergistic pathways, including disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and induction of massive ROS accumulation, thereby interfering with the proton motive force (PMF), depleting intracellular ATP, and blocking energy metabolism. In the mouse infection model, the Elaiophylin-treated group showed a significantly increased survival rate of 60% and effectively reduced bacterial loads in tissues. This study demonstrates that Elaiophylin is a highly promising natural candidate drug with multi-target synergistic effects, offering a new strategy to combat MDR S. suis and biofilm-associated infections."

We show in this study that Aer also senses oxidative stress and performs FAD-dependent negative chemotaxis in response to the known ROS H2O2. The ability of Aer to detect both oxidizing and reducing intracellular environments redefines its functional range and establishes Aer as a bidirectional redox sensor. We show in addition that the ability of bacterial swarms to move away from bactericidal antibiotics is Aer-dependent and is abolished by expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG, which scavenges intracellular ROS. Our study thus provides independent behavioral evidence that certain antibiotics generate intracellular ROS, while also offering a sensitive assay for detecting these reactive species."

    "content": "Intracellular bacterial symbioses have arisen myriad times in eukaryotes, with dozens known from insects alone. Beginning with Buchnera, the obligate endosymbiont of aphids, genomes of endosymbionts have illuminated their evolutionary origins and metabolic contributions to hosts. However, the mechanisms by which nonculturable endosymbionts enter host cells and suppress cellular immune processes have remained unknown. We show that an uncharacterized Buchnera protein, here designated SyeA, was present in the Buchnera ancestor, is secreted and homologous to secreted effectors of bacterial pathogens and is essential for Buchnera transmission. Buchnera is transmitted via expulsion from specialized maternal cells and uptake by embryos. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that SyeA levels peak upon colonization, accompanied by actin accumulation at the entry site. SyeA localizes outside the host-derived membrane and actin layer surrounding each Buchnera cell and colocalizes in host cytoplasm with Rho1, which regulates actin polymerization. syeA knockdown disrupts colonization and embryonic development and elevates lysosomal activity, leading to Buchnera destruction6. Our findings provide rare insight into how an anciently associated, mutualistic endosymbiont achieves its intracellular existence. SyeA is a vestige of pathogenic origins followed by evolution of increased host control and erosion of the original, more complex pathogenicity machinery."

Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of 191 wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from six populations from Alaskan lakes spanning a gradient of surface area. We tested how environmental context (lake size and ecotype) and host traits (sex, body mass, gravidity, Schistocephalus solidus (S. solidus) infection, and fibrosis) influence stickleback gut microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the lake surface area strongly predicted fish gut microbial alpha diversity. Fish from intermediate-sized lakes harbored significantly more diverse microbiota than those from small and large lakes, independent of ecotype. Body mass was associated with gut microbial diversity. Model-predicted marginal effects from the mass and lake surface area interaction analysis showed that the association between fish mass and microbial alpha diversity was strongly negative in the smallest lakes, weakest in intermediate-sized lakes, and strongly positive in the largest lakes. In addition, sex and S. solidus infection were significantly associated with gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity, whereas fibrosis and gravidity showed minimal effects. Differential abundance analysis revealed lake size-dependent associations between body mass and individual taxa. Together, these results demonstrate that both habitat context and host variation interactively shape stickleback gut microbial communities in the wild. Integrating lake-level and individual-level analyses reveals how ecological setting modulates host-microbe associations, offering insights into the role of the gut microbiota in host adaptation and population divergence."

In Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/Y/Z assembly associates with and translocates across the nucleoid in a PomZ ATPase-dependent manner to position the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring at midcell. Unlike other systems incorporating a ParA/MinD ATPase, the PomX/Y/Z system incorporates two ATPase Activating Proteins (AAPs), PomX and PomY, that stimulate PomZ activity. While PomX AAP activity, similarly to other characterized AAPs of ParA/MinD ATPases, resides in a short positively charged N-terminal peptide (PomXNPEP), the mechanism of PomY-mediated activation of PomZ remained unknown. We map PomY AAP activity to its C-terminal residues 496-682 (PomY496-682) and show that this activity is important for division site positioning and the initiation of cell division. Structural modeling suggests a bipartite PomY496-682 architecture, comprising a globular domain and an intrinsically disordered region containing the short 5 helix. However, modeling supported an interaction only between 5 and the PomZ dimer. The 5 binding site partially overlaps with that of the prototype AAP ParB on the ParA dimer but 5 lacks a positively charged residue critical for ParB AAP activity. Modeling supported that PomXNPEP binds the PomZ dimer at a site distinct from that of 5 and which overlaps with that of the prototype AAP MinE on the MinD dimer. These findings reveal a non-canonical AAP mechanism of PomY, while PomXNPEP likely functions analogously to MinE, indicating that PomX and PomY act in concert through distinct but complementary mechanisms to stimulate PomZ ATPase activity, thereby efficiently driving the positioning of the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring."

    "content": "Multiple enteroviruses are associated with life-threatening and economically important diseases, yet licensed vaccines are available only against poliovirus (worldwide) and enterovirus A71 (China). Both live attenuated and inactivated anti-poliovirus vaccines, while highly successful in preventing the disease, have important shortcomings. Live vaccine strains are inherently genetically unstable and can regain virulence, leading to re-emergence of paralytic disease. Inactivated vaccine does not induce the mucosal immunity sufficient to interrupt viral transmission and is made from virulent strains, presenting a biosafety challenge. Recent alternatives, such as new vaccine strains with improved genetic stability and VLP-based vaccines, only partially address these concerns. Here, we investigated another approach to the development of anti-enterovirus vaccines based on efficient trans-encaspidation of replication-competent enterovirus RNAs coding for only the non-structural proteins (replicons) by Newcastle Disease virus vectors expressing enterovirus capsid proteins. Thus, the encapsidated replicon production is driven by effectively replicating enterovirus RNA and the NDV vector. This system is easily scalable and can be adapted to any cell culture provided it can be infected by both the enterovirus and NDV. Unlike the empty VLPs, the encapsidated replicons recapitulate the stability and antigenicity of native enterovirus particles, but cannot propagate beyond the originally infected cell. The protective efficacy of an encapsidated poliovirus replicon immunization was similar to that of the licensed Sabin vaccine strain in a murine model. This approach can easily be adapted to any enterovirus, allowing the rapid development of new, affordable vaccine candidates."

    "content": "Archaea of the order Sulfolobales possess eukaryotic-like cell cycle. The chromatin organization in these archaea is supposed to rely on nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Genomes of Sulfolobales species encode multiple members of the Lrs14 protein family, which have been postulated to function as NAPs. Here, we show that one of the Lrs14 family protein, named Sul14a, is a potential key player in dynamic chromatin organization in Saccharolobus islandicus. Sul14a is transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and appears to be essential for cell viability. The protein exhibits DNA-binding activity preferring AT-rich sequences and can bridge DNA in vitro. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Sul14a is enriched at AT-rich regions of the chromatin. Overexpression of Sul14a leads to cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and transcriptomic analyses indicate that Sul14a overexpression results in chromatin contact reduction and global transcriptional changes. In addition, we observed that the chromatin contact pattern changes markedly between 1h and 5h after release from G2 synchronization, corresponding to the lowest and highest levels of sul14a transcription, respectively, during the cell cycle. Our results establish that Sul14a is an NAP intimately associated with chromatin dynamics and global transcriptional changes during the cell cycle in Sulfolobales."

    "content": "The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis has sparked renewed interest in using bacteriophage (phage) as a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Phage are viruses that infect and often kill bacteria, and have served as key models for many molecular biology studies. There are many complex phage-bacterial interactions that dictate the success or failure of the phage life cycle, but many of these are not well understood or characterised. These include the specific interactions to recognize a bacterium during the infection process, bacterial phage defence mechanisms and metabolic pathways that are key to phage replication. In this study a novel Escherichia coli phage, Arnold, is characterised and the genome sequence is reported. We then use transposon-directed insertion sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of E. coli mutants to identify over 200 genes involved in Arnold phage infection or in phage resistance. Using this approach, we identified both an outer membrane protein (BtuB, vitamin B12 transporter) and an inner membrane protein (SdaC, serine/proton symporter) involved in phage infection. Deletions in these genes were shown to provide immunity to infection by this phage. Understanding the genetic basis of phage infection and phage resistance should allow us to select or design phage to target specific bacterial pathogens in the future."

    "content": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum depends entirely on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, as it is unable to salvage these essential nucleotides. This reliance makes the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway a compelling target for antimalarial drugs, with several inhibitors targeting its rate-limiting enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), already in clinical development. In this study, we investigated the roles of three other pathway enzymes - aspartate transcarbamoylase (PfATC), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (PfCPSII), and dihydroorotase (PfDHO). PfATC features a unique N-terminal extension predicted to serve as an apicoplast trafficking peptide. However, using antibodies against the native protein and an epitope-tagged version, we found no evidence of apicoplast localization. Knockdown of PfATC expression proved lethal and could not be rescued by an apicoplast metabolic bypass. Complementation assays further revealed that truncation of the N-terminal domain impaired parasite growth, suggesting that this region is important for PfATC function or stability in vivo. PfCPSII, which harbors large Plasmodium-specific insertions between its catalytic domains, was likewise found to be essential for parasite proliferation. To assess the role of PfDHO, we engineered parasites to salvage uracil via heterologous expression of a yeast enzyme. Deletion of PfDHO in this parasite line resulted in uracil auxotrophy, confirming the enzyme's essential function in pyrimidine synthesis. Together, these findings reveal multiple vulnerable nodes within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway."

    "content": "When bacteriophages infect starved host bacteria, the restrictive host physiology may lead to prolonged latent periods and/or reduced burst sizes, compared to infection of a fast-growing bacterium. Using a mathematical model, we explore a system of two types of virulent phages that have distinct host physiology dependencies and are infecting a shared bacterial host population. We consider different environmental regimes to test whether they can compete and coexist under fluctuating conditions, putting emphasis on phases with limited resources for bacterial growth. We find that phages capable of delaying lysis in response to nutrient limitations can outcompete fast-replicating phages in feast-famine environments. This advantage mainly stems from increased mortality of free phages due to abortive adsorption to already infected hosts during starvation phases. We identify specific system dynamics that either support or suppress the propagation of the delayed lysis phage. This theoretical analysis highlights the competitive benefits and the limitations of delayed lysis as a phage propagation strategy. Our results underscore importance of considering the bacterial physiology dependence of bacteriophage replication in order to correctly predict phage fitness and population dynamics in complex environments."

    "content": "Microbial sulfate reduction is a cornerstone of marine sediment biogeochemistry, driving carbon remineralization and fueling the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Yet in zones of high methane flux, sulfate limitations may constrain the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that typically perform AOM. Although often overlooked, sulfur redox intermediates are readily utilized by diverse microorganisms, potentially driving AOM in sulfate-limited zones. To resolve the microbial mechanisms underlying cryptic sulfur cycling in such sediments, Monterey Canyon cold methane seeps were investigated through an integrated geochemical, isotopic, and metatranscriptomic approach. High-resolution electrochemical measurements confirmed intense sulfide production in seep sites, and long-term anoxic incubations were conducted with sediment from the SMTZ amended with elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or sulfate as the sole sulfur source, with or without methane. Over 650 days, sulfide accumulation was greatest in elemental sulfur treatments, followed by thiosulfate and sulfate; in all cases methane addition enhanced sulfide production. Isotopic measurements showed modest S-isotope fractionation indicating that the large fractionations typical of slow sulfate reduction were muted by additional sulfur transformations. In elemental sulfur treatments, isotopic and geochemical patterns suggested that disproportionation was unlikely. Metatranscriptomes revealed broad expression of sox genes and abundant dsr/apr across treatments, along with thiosulfate-linked phs upregulation. While ANME-2c and SEEP-SRB2 activity increased with methane, transcriptomic and isotopic data together highlighted the roles of Desulfocapsaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Sulfurovaceae lineages in mediating sulfur transformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate how cryptic sulfur cycling may sustain microbial communities in sulfate-depleted deep-sea sediments and contribute to AOM."

ALAN increased M. aquaticum height and total biomass, but had no effect on native species growth. In feeding assays, P. canaliculata consumed all three native species but consistently avoided M. aquaticum under both light treatments. C. chinensis showed no feeding in no-choice assays, but in choice assays, consumed H. verticillata and M. spicatum under No-ALAN and only M. spicatum under ALAN. In community mesocosms, P. canaliculata reduced native macrophyte biomass by 48.0% under No-ALAN and 87.2% under ALAN without affecting M. aquaticum. This selective feeding increased M. aquaticum's proportional biomass, with a stronger effect under ALAN than No-ALAN. These results suggest that ALAN can indirectly facilitate non-native macrophyte invasion by amplifying their relative biomass within native communities, particularly in the presence of invasive herbivores, and may promote invasional meltdown through altered feeding preferences."

Peterson & Saarela (synonym Spartina anglica) is a highly invasive coastal weed that forms dense monocultures in intertidal mudflats and estuaries, displacing native reedbeds and associated fauna. Introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand from Britain in the early 1900s to aid coastal land reclamation, it became a conservation concern by the 1960s, prompting control efforts in the South Island from the 1970s. This study presents a detailed S. anglicus eradication case study from the Marlborough Sounds, where detections are nearing zero. We model changes in detection probability over time in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound, a complex estuarine catchment. We aim to inform control efforts and assess the effectiveness of ongoing management, by evaluating the probability of non-detection as a proxy for functional eradication. Using data from the Department of Conservation (DOC), we analysed detections across 79 search blocks between 2013 and 2024. A generalised linear mixed model was used to generate predicted detections through to 2040, using a modified dataset with pseudo-zero values for probable absences. The data were modelled as presence/absence with a binomial distribution, to identify the first year with a <0.01 probability of a positive detection (upper 99% confidence limit). Results suggest that by 2032, the likelihood of further detections under current management practices is remote, and that functional eradication may have occurred. We interpret this decline in detection probability as indicative of management success. Model outputs can support decision-making as to when active surveillance might reasonably be ceased. To accelerate the tail-end of eradication efforts, we recommend intensifying search effort and widening delimitations within the catchment over the next five years, to ensure removal of any remaining individuals. We also propose the use of environmental DNA as a cost-effective backstop for after operational wind-down."

    "content": "Climate warming is altering the timing of seasonal growth in cold-temperate and boreal ecosystems, with potential consequences for forests on multiple continents. It has been hypothesized that in a warming climate, earlier growth in spring might lead to a longer growing season and thus higher annual total growth. However, whether the period of active growth is longer in a warming climate is unclear, as is whether changes in growth rate might reinforce or offset the effect of changing growing season length in modulating annual total growth. Understanding responses in growth to warming is crucial to projecting forest dynamics under future climate change. To address this, we experimentally warmed (by +1.62 and 3.26 {degrees}C on average) open-air southern boreal forest plots for 14 years (2010 to 2023) and measured juvenile height growth from spring until fall for 20 tree and shrub species, with a total of 11,565 individual-year growth trajectories. Across all species and in various canopy (open, closed) and rainfall (ambient, reduced) contexts, experimental warming consistently advanced the timing of height growth (4.32 days per 3 {degrees}C warming). However, species differed in their annual total growth responses. Evergreen gymnosperms such as spruce, fir, and pine tended to exhibit suppressed annual total growth under warming (-15.8% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by a shorter duration of active growth, despite an earlier start, with little change in relative growth rate. In contrast, deciduous angiosperms and non-native shrubs often show enhanced annual total growth under warming (19.3 and 37.4% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by faster rate, longer duration, or a combination of both. More broadly, species with a more conservative lifestyle responded less positively in the duration and rate of growth, thus placing them at a disadvantage under warming. These contrasting responses challenge assumptions that an earlier start of the growing season universally enhances growth and highlight how warming may shift both the timing and pace of growth and thus alter community composition within mixed-species forests."

    "content": "The location at which a species assemblage is observed can be uncertain, for example in fisheries where catch composition is recorded accurately but location data may be coarse or inaccurate. In such cases, spatial signals in observed species compositions can help identify and refine uncertain locations. This study explored three approaches for location estimation using species composition data: 1) a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that jointly estimates species distributions and location uncertainty, 2) an inverse prediction method that uses a fitted SDM to identify the most likely location given new species data, and 3) the direct modeling of location as the response variable. Each approach requires a subset of observations with accurate locations to quantify the spatial patterns in species distributions. All three methods were useful and reasonably accurate: for the simulated data the average distance error (distance to true location) was 15% the size of the domain, and for the real data this error was 20-100 km. When only some locations are uncertain, the hierarchical approach is valuable due to its integrated estimation of location and species parameters. When many locations are uncertain, the other approaches seem more suitable. Inverse prediction is ideal when prior information is available to constrain the location estimation. Direct modelling (although causally spurious) is well suited to large datasets, with multivariate random forests often providing the most accurate location estimates. These methods can enhance spatial data quality in ecological monitoring and help develop tools for improving inaccurate or deliberately misreported fishing locations."

Here, we provide direct evidence for active anaerobic metabolism in the GVC by measuring hydrogen (H2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) production, indicative of microbial fermentation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification. Changes in GVC H2 concentrations after feeding suggest that feeding modulates substrate availability, which in turn influences microbial activity in this compartment. In bleached corals, the GVC remained consistently hypoxic and acidic, and anaerobic metabolic processes persisted across the diel cycle. These patterns suggest a shift in energy and nutrient cycling pathways within the bleached coral holobiont. Together, our findings identify the GVC as a dynamic site of microbial activity that may play an important role in holobiont carbon and nitrogen cycling, with potential implications for nutrient balance and coral resilience."

    "content": "1. Microclimates are critical for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behaviour, physiology, and species distributions. However, traditional physical heat-balance models for predicting ground temperatures in microhabitats often exhibit biases due to unaccounted environmental complexities and poorly constrained parameters. These limitations can hinder ecological research and conservation planning, particularly in the context of climate change. 2. In this study, we demonstrate how high-resolution drone-based mapping and machine learning can improve the accuracy of microclimate models. Using drone imagery, we generated detailed environmental maps, including solar radiation, vegetation indices, and skyview factors, to parameterize a physical heat-balance model. Validation with thermal maps derived from drone-mounted infrared cameras revealed systematic errors in the physical model's predictions, including over- and underestimations under specific environmental conditions. To address these errors, we applied a random forest machine learning model to predict and correct biases in new prediction maps. 3. Our results show that machine learning reduced mean absolute errors by over 30% and mean square errors by 50%, while consistently narrowing the range of prediction inaccuracies. Key factors driving biases, such as vegetation cover, solar radiation, and height above ground, were identified, offering valuable insights for improving physical models. The machine learning corrections not only improved accuracy but also highlighted parameters and processes that were previously underrepresented or oversimplified in traditional models. 4. These findings illustrate the potential of ML to improve microclimate predictions. While our drone-based approach is most applicable to open, sparsely vegetated habitats, the principle of ML bias correction can be extended to other systems as well. Correcting microclimate models with ML and observational data provides ecologists and conservation practitioners with a powerful framework for generating more accurate microclimate estimates. Such improvements deepen our understanding of species' responses to climate change and support climate-resilient management strategies."

    "content": "The malarial parasite emph{Plasmodium vivax} has infected humans for millennia. As such, alleles like the FY*O allele in the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and the sickle cell allele (HbS) have been naturally selected for in malaria-endemic regions because they confer resistance to malaria, thereby increasing the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying these protective alleles. As resistance becomes more common in a population, malaria incidence is expected to decline, reducing the evolutionary pressure for additional resistance. In this work, we explore the interaction between these processes. We construct a model with seasonality that tracks the frequency of Duffy genotypes and leverages fast/slow dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamics of malaria transmission and changes in the gene frequency of the DARC genotype. Specifically, we investigate how the burden of malaria changes with the fractions of people with the various DARC genotypes. We derive the basic reproduction number as the threshold condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and interpret the $R_0$ as a weighted sum of the cases generated by infected individuals of each genotype. Additionally, we calibrate our model using data from the Amazonas region in Brazil, which has a polymorphic population with respect to DARC, and still reports a substantial number of emph{P. vivax} cases. Analysis of our model determines the proportion of the population that must be Duffy-negative in order for the entire population to be protected against emph{P. vivax} without any further interventions. Furthermore, we assess how different proportions of Duffy-negative individuals influence the monthly incidence of emph{P. vivax} cases."

    "content": "Understanding the cascading effects of forest decline on saproxylic communities is fundamental for optimizing the management of disturbed forests toward biodiversity conservation objectives. We postulated that the nature and intensity of cascading pathways would vary along decline gradients, encompassing stages from stand decline to mortality and subsequent salvage logging, as mediated by shifts in habitat conditions and resource availability. This study was conducted across three representative European forest contexts: fir forests in the French Pyrenees, spruce forests in Bavaria (Germany), and oak forests in the lowlands of the Loire Valley (France). Within these systems, we assessed how the taxonomic and functional -diversity of saproxylic beetles responded to variations in both the diversity and density of deadwood and tree-related microhabitats (TreMs). Our analyses identified key cascading effects of stand decline and mortality that were shaped by the considered beetle guild and by the forest type, reflecting tree species-specific disturbance legacies. Stand decline and mortality produced distinct responses within saproxylic beetle assemblages, as different successional guilds preferentially utilized either dying or dead trees. The overall influence of decline processes was positive in conifer-dominated forests. TreMs played a central role in mediating cascading processes structuring saproxylic beetle communities throughout the forest decline continuum. The increase in TreM heterogeneity associated with stand decline or mortality enhanced saproxylic diversity, with exposed wood and trunk injuries identified as particularly influential microhabitats. Snags and large deadwood elements, especially in spruce forests, and deadwood diversity further contributed to sustaining high levels of beetle diversity. Conversely, salvage logging exerted detrimental effects on numerous guilds, primarily through reductions in TreM diversity, decreased TreM trait dispersion, and the depletion of saproxylic TreMs. Given the pronounced context dependency of the processes driving these cascading community dynamics, and considering the increasing frequency, severity, and spatial extent of forest disturbances and global forest decline, it is imperative to integrate this complexity into management and conservation frameworks. Addressing these mechanisms with greater precision will be critical for maintaining functional biodiversity within rapidly changing forest ecosystems."

Natural history museums can enhance the study of zoonoses by serving as valuable resources for understanding the ecology and evolutionary history of pathogens and their wildlife hosts. Despite the growing interest in the role museums can play in pathobiology research and zoonotic risk assessment, there remains a lack of centralized resources for locating tissue samples that may be leveraged for pathogen discovery. Using the worlds most significant global aggregator of museum specimens, The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we examined how such tools could be adopted to identify specimens that might be sources of viral genetic material. Focusing on tissue samples from the mammalian orders Rodentia and Chiroptera, speciose taxa that host a high diversity of known zoonotic viruses, we examined temporal, spatial, and taxonomic gaps and patterns in the available tissue samples. Our analyses reveal a heavy bias toward tissue samples collected from the Americas (and consequently, taxonomic groups found in the Americas), with most collected samples housed in North American institutions. This limits the scope of future pathogen discovery efforts and presents a barrier to pandemic preparedness in the Global South. We also examine gaps in metadata quality (e.g., descriptions of preservation method and storage medium) and outline recommendations for GBIF to facilitate future biosurveillance projects and effectively incorporate natural history museums into One Health disease research."

    "content": "Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an invasive parasitic nematode and zoonotic pathogen responsible for eosinophilic meningitis. Originally native to Southeast Asia, it is now globally distributed across tropical and subtropical regions and is approaching Europe, with Tenerife as a key hotspot. This study investigates the distribution and prevalence of A. cantonensis in Tenerife across three host groups (rats, gastropods, lizards). Based on prevalence data, we modelled its potential distribution using species distribution models (SDMs) and compared climatic conditions with Hawaii, a region with frequent human cases. Field surveys confirmed A. cantonensis in endemic and introduced gastropods (25.6%; 179/698), rats (21.5%; 14/79), and lizards (24.0%; 31/129), with local prevalence ranging from 2.4% to 41.6%. MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree models identified precipitation seasonality as the main driver of distribution, while prevalence was influenced primarily by tree cover density and climatic variability. Northeastern Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro showed the highest habitat suitability. However, overlap with densely populated areas was limited, possibly explaining the absence of reported human cases. The MESS analysis, based on climatic data from Hawaii, indicated moderate to high environmental similarity across most of the Canary Islands, except in northeastern Tenerife, where conditions were outside the range observed in Hawaii. A. cantonensis is firmly established in Tenerife, but human cases remain absent, likely due to limited human exposure, cultural practices, and geographic separation of parasite hotspots from urban zones. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating ecological and epidemiological data in zoonotic risk assessments."

    "content": "Species interactions are fundamental to maintaining biodiversity. However, how these interactions change over time in response to varying climatic conditions has been poorly explored. This gap limits our ability to identify how temporal changes in coexistence mechanisms sustain diverse communities. Here, we present a modeling approach, coupled with theory, to evaluate how temporal changes in species competitive and mutualistic interactions and intrinsic growth rates promote structural stability. We illustrate our framework using two highly replicated yet independent datasets: (1) annual plant grasslands and (2) wild bee assemblages in shrublands, both subjected to the same variation in rainfall over nine years. We found that both systems respond similarly to year-to-year rainfall changes despite their disparate evolutionary backgrounds. While rainfall variability fosters more diverse communities, prolonged drought leads to substantial biodiversity loss. Although the spatial context dependency modifies some responses, the structural stability of most communities persists through time, with clear winners and losers emerging under environmental variability. The main underlying mechanism determining the observed community stability is a combination of species-specific changes in their growth rates, an increase in the variability of interspecific interactions, and a reduction in the strength of self-limiting effects. Our results underscore the need to consider time-varying species interactions to understand community stability under contrasting climatic conditions and to predict how climate severity influences biodiversity loss."

Our analyses of those data quantified the benefits of spatial fishery closures, known as Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs), on 28 species of groundfish occupying a wide range of distances from RCAs (inside RCAs to {approx}150 km away). On average, body sizes and relative abundance increased by 1.1% and 11.0%, respectively, per 5 km-increase in RCA proximity. Variation around these average responses depended on the species' life history characteristics, RCA location, and historical impacts from commercial fishing. Additionally, the benefits of spatial protection increased with time since RCA implementation."

Manual annotations and basic thresholding method were used to quantify detection success. Results showed that detection rates were highest when surveys were conducted under cooler ambient temperatures and at moderate altitudes (e.g. 60 metres AGL) with 50% image overlap.

Composed of both bacteria and protists, biofilm communities are shaped by environmental conditions and the lifestyle traits of their constituent organisms. Although biofilm and planktonic communities may share some taxa, the extent of the overlap and the factors driving community differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial and protist communities associated with Phragmites australis stem biofilms and planktonic fractions across five lakes spanning an eutrophication gradient in the Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland. The biofilm communities on reed stems were highly distinct from planktonic ones, sharing only a small core microbiome. The biofilm core not only exceeded that of planktonic communities but also contained characteristic taxa, identified via machine learning, that were distinct from planktonic assemblages, including several with potential roles in bioremediation and as bioindicators. Planktonic communities were strongly influenced by environmental factors, whereas Phragmites australis-associated epiphytic biofilm communities appeared more uniform across lakes, consistent with host-associated selection and potentially with lifestyle-related buffering. Moreover, biofilm suspensions exhibited higher apparent physiological activity per inoculum volume and broader substrate use under our assay conditions than the free-living communities. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the ecological significance of biofilms in freshwater systems and underscore the need to integrate both biofilm and planktonic fractions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to fully capture microbial diversity, function, and ecosystem resilience."

Here, we investigated which functional species traits (scale type, schooling behaviour, and position-in-water-column) are selected for by eDNA metabarcoding and beach seines in nearshore eelgrass, mixed eelgrass, and understory kelp habitats. Using data from 35 sites across southeast Alaska, we applied occupancy modeling to estimate detection of species traits by each gear type. Detection probability with eDNA was 27 times greater for species with deciduous scales compared to species with non-deciduous scales, and lower for species with plates (rather than scales). Conversely, species with plates showed greater odds of detection with beach seines. Given the novelty of eDNA sampling, quantifying interactions between functional traits and gear selectivity will be important to accurately characterize species distributions across marine habitats."

Here, we present an extensive field-based study of small mammals and their multiple pathogens to assess diversity-disease relationships at a local scale, revealing pathogen-specific patterns. While no significant association was detected between the prevalence of some pathogens and host diversity, others such as Orthopoxvirus and a strain of Mycoplasma haemomuris exhibited dilution effect patterns, whereas another Mycoplasma haemomuris strain and Mycoplasma coccoides displayed amplification effects. Crucially, we demonstrate that these contrasting outcomes are consistently explained by the host competence-abundance relationship. Our findings underscore the importance of host community composition and highlight the need to consider multiple pathogens when evaluating the ecological mechanisms underpinning the diversity-disease relationships."

Among the most affected habitats are coastal communities, which host many endemic taxa and provide valuable ecosystem services. One such invasive taxa is Kalanchoe xhoughtonii, an allegedly artificial hybrid. This plant, although having demonstrated strong invasive potential, still largely remains unrecognised as a taxon of concern in Mediterranean countries, at least in national official catalogues. In this study, we assess the impact of this hybrid on coastal communities, focusing on the European Union Habitat of Community Interest (HCI) 1240--''vegetated cliffs with endemic statices (Limonium spp.)''--at two sites along the southern coast of Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). Between 2022 and 2025, we conducted field surveys to document the population size, growth stages, and spatial competition with native species. Additionally, we gathered 1,422 iNaturalist occurrences of K. xhoughtonii to map its distribution across the Mediterranean Basin, assess its presence within Natura 2000 protected sites and within protected areas, including the HCI 1240, and determine its potential spread using ensemble ecological niche modelling with bioclimatic variables. Our results show that K. xhoughtonii forms dense monospecific patches in the surveyed areas that compete for space with two native Limonium species in southern Catalonia. Moreover, we confirmed 713 naturalised occurrences in the Mediterranean area, 107 were located within Natura 2000 protected sites and 58 within the HCI 1240 included in protected sites. Ecological niche modelling indicates high climatic suitability across 93% of western and 59% of eastern Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites containing the HCI 1240. The findings of this study highlight the invasive potential of K. xhoughtonii and support its inclusion in national catalogues of invasive species across Mediterranean basin countries. The study calls for systematic monitoring of the spread and ecological impact of this hybrid species in coastal community habitats."

Here, we design an activatable trident-like fluorescent peptide probe (RMN) to bind with the ovarian tumor-overexpressed N-cadherin and respond to the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Here, we developed a method to identify B cell epitopes by characterizing &gt;437,000 peptides tested for IgG binding and &gt;370 million B cell receptor (BCR) clones. Our single-cell BCR sequencing of pre\u2013 and post\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination validates the performance of this method. Mouse vaccination experiments demonstrate that B cell neoepitopes enhance immune responses, driving BCR expansion and tumor regression. Genomic analysis of &gt;8000 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples reveals an inverse correlation between predicted B cell reactivity and mutation allele frequencies, indicating B cell\u2013mediated neoantigen elimination. Applying our multiomics model to checkpoint blockade responses in 2074 patients highlights the clinical relevance of B cell neoepitope prediction. A meta-analysis of 11 personalized vaccine trials involving 1739 neoantigens suggests that incorporating B cell neoepitopes may improve vaccination efficacy. These results underscore the significance of B cell\u2013reactive neoantigens in antitumor immunity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

This process involves system- and synaptic-level changes and predominantly occurs during sleep. While hippocampal-cortical circuits are well studied in this context, the contributions of other systems, including dopaminergic circuits\u2014key players in learning-related processes\u2014remain poorly understood. Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    ) neurons are active during sleep and suggested to participate in memory consolidation processes; however, causal evidence for this is lacking. Using calcium-dependent fiber photometry, electrophysiology, and chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations across learning paradigms, we explore the functions of VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    neuronal activity during sleep. We show that VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    activity during nonrapid eye movement sleep is experience dependent, is enhanced by motor skill and associative learning, facilitates motor skill memory consolidation, and exhibits a motor learning\u2013dependent increase in temporal coordination with cortical spindle oscillations.

The pathophysiology underlying LID is poorly understood, and treatment options are limited. To move toward filling this treatment gap, the intrinsic and synaptic changes in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) triggered by the sustained elevation of dopamine (DA) during dyskinesia were characterized using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular, and behavioral approaches. Our studies revealed that the intrinsic excitability and functional corticostriatal connectivity of SPNs in dyskinetic mice oscillate between LID on- and off-states in a cell- and state-specific manner. Although triggered by levodopa, these oscillations in SPN properties depended on both dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling. Disrupting M1 muscarinic receptor signaling specifically in indirect pathway SPNs or deleting its downstream signaling partner CalDAG-GEFI blunted the levodopa-induced alterations in functional connectivity, enhanced the motoric benefits of levodopa, and attenuated LID severity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

X-ray crystallography can reveal these changes in atomic detail, but standard analysis methods, which refine separate datasets, often overlook differences that are subtle or arise in only a subset of molecules. Direct comparison of crystallographic datasets is, in principle, more powerful, but systematic errors (\u201cscales\u201d) often mask changes in the crystallographic observables (\u201cstructure factors\u201d). Machine learning algorithms that jointly estimate scales and structure factors can address this limitation. Here, we augment this approach with multivariate, structured priors derived from crystallographic theory, implemented in the variational deep learning framework Careless. Doing so strongly improves the detection of protein dynamics, element-specific anomalous signals, and the binding of drug candidates, offering a robust approach to comparative crystallography and, potentially, to detection of protein dynamics by other structure determination methods.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Thirty-two isolates were assigned to the same species with all four assembly-based classifiers, while the remaining 25 showed diverging assignments. When evaluating the results for the latter isolates, GTDB-Tk performed better than the other classifiers regarding which assignments were most likely correct. Of the read-based classifiers, MetaPhlAn4 performed better than Kraken2. Our evaluation identified GTDB-Tk to be the strongest tool for taxonomic assignment of isolates that are difficult to identify. Disagreements between classifiers are likely due to database limitations, wrongly assigned taxonomy, or unreliable 16S rRNA gene-based assignments.</span>"

Hence, methodological variations related to the separation of extracellular and intracellular DNA can severely distort the outcome of eDNA\u2010based studies.\n\nABSTRACT\nGetting insights into the quantitative and qualitative contribution of different DNA states, i.e., extracellular (exDNA) and intracellular DNA (iDNA), to the total environmental DNA (eDNA) pool requires reliable methods for their separation. Even though a multitude of respective extraction protocols has been published, their validation is often missing. Here, we selected four protocols for the state\u2010specific extraction of eDNA and traced the separation of exDNA and iDNA within natural environments using previously designed spike\u2010and\u2010recovery controls. Besides accounting for the different eDNA states, the spike\u2010ins also distinguished different bacterial origins (gram\u2010positive, gram\u2010negative). Following their quantification by digital PCR, the recovery of exDNA and iDNA spike\u2010ins in both the target as well as nontarget eDNA states differed among the selected extraction protocols and environmental matrices, albeit the effect of the former was far more decisive. While the recovery of exDNA spike\u2010ins was mainly affected by the chemical composition of the washing buffer and the duration of each washing step, the lysis method determined the recovery of spiked iDNA. These aspects were further combined within an optimised protocol, providing a valuable step towards a more concise understanding of factors governing the state\u2010specific extraction of eDNA and hence their relevance in molecular microbial ecology."

    "content": "Abstract\nA significant quantity of soil organic carbon (SOC) is buried in mangrove ecosystems. However, recent research has revealed that substantial amounts of carbon are exported to the atmosphere as CO2 or to the ocean as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC). This carbon outflow highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of carbon burial, outgassing, and outwelling to clarify the role of mangroves in net atmospheric CO2 removal. To elucidate the carbon cycle within a mangrove ecosystem, we quantified CO2 outgassing through high\u2010resolution measurements CO2 and porewater\u2010derived fluxes of total alkalinity, DIC, DOC, and POC using radium isotopes (224Ra and 223Ra) in an island mangrove ecosystem in Japan. Our findings showed that the dominant carbon flux was DIC outwelling, at 189\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0mmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0day\u22121, approximately 2.3 times higher than the global median. This pronounced DIC outwelling likely reflects the presence of a vast reservoir of poorly stabilized SOC. A comparison with ecosystem\u2010scale CO2 emissions revealed that approximately 89% of the DIC was transported into the estuary without being emitted as CO2. This high DIC transport appears to result from the efficient water exchange characteristic of island mangroves, with a creek residence time of \u223c1\u00a0day. Surprisingly, the adjacent estuary acted as a net CO2 sink, surpassing CO2 outgassing from the mangrove creeks. These results suggest that efficient water exchange in island mangroves, coupled with high biological productivity at the adjacent estuary, promotes long\u2010term sequestration of mangrove\u2010derived DIC in the ocean."

Combining modeling and experiments on Daphnia, we show that food quality, quantity and thermal variability jointly constrain TSR expression, potentially leading to smaller yet older individuals at maturity.\n\nABSTRACT\nEctotherms tend to mature at smaller sizes as average temperatures rise, a pattern known as the Temperature\u2010Size Rule (TSR), which also predicts earlier age at maturity. However, in natural environments, warming is often accompanied by increased thermal variability and limited nutritional resources. Using a bioenergetic model combined with factorial growth experiments on Daphnia, we investigated how temperature, food concentration, and food quality (Polyunsaturated fatty acid and sterol content) jointly shape size and age at maturity. We find that poor food quality narrows the upper thermal limit for TSR expression, while low food quantity restricts both upper and lower thermal bounds. Increased thermal variability shifts this range towards cooler temperatures. These findings suggest that the TSR may not hold under ecologically realistic conditions, especially when organisms are close to their thermal optimum where small concomitant increases of resource limitation and temperature variability with warming may lead to smaller yet older individuals at maturity."

    "content": "<p>by Assaf Biran, Yaron E. Antebi</p>\n\nSignaling pathways enable cells to coordinate collective behaviors by exchanging specific information. Many pathways utilize multiple ligand variants to activate the same intracellular signaling cascade, raising the question of how cells discriminate between these seemingly redundant signals. It has been shown that individual cells can discriminate between signals based on their induced level of activity, temporal dynamics or combinatorial effect. Here, we demonstrate that ligand discrimination could also emerge at the population level. Using mathematical models of ligand-receptor interactions, we examine how response heterogeneity at the population level can encode ligand identity. We introduce a local scaling metric to quantify how variation in pathway components affects the cellular response. Our results reveal that for pathways with dimeric receptors, and more significantly for heterodimeric receptors, biochemical parameters of the ligands control the resulting heterogeneity in the response of a population of cells. Furthermore, we show that the population-level heterogeneity encodes the enzymatic activity of the resulting receptor complex. This suggests a functional advantage for utilizing heterodimeric receptor complexes in pathways acting across a population of cells, such as the type I interferon pathway, which shows several of the characteristics of our model. This contrasts to juxtacrine pathways, such as Notch, that do not act at the population level and use a single component receptor. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which receptor architecture enables cells to encode ligand-specific information through population-level heterogeneity, offering insights into immune regulation, tissue development, and synthetic biology."

    "content": "<p>by Jakub L\u00e1la, Ayham Al-Saffar, Stefano Angioletti-Uberti</p>\n\nDespite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics."

    "content": "<p>by Leonardo Agasso, Ivan Molineris, Michele Caselle</p>\n\nTwo rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred about 500 million years ago and played a major role in the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Human genes derived from WGD are called \u201cohnologs\u201d. Ohnologs are involved in fundamental biological processes and significantly contributed to the complexity of the human gene regulatory network. Given the central role of miRNAs in gene regulation, we investigated the contribution of ohnolog miRNAs (ohno-miRNAs) to the human gene regulatory network. We identified intragenic ohno-miRNAs as having higher retention rates compared to intragenic Small Scale Duplicated (SSD) miRNAs. Ohno-miRNAs also show high sequence similarity, a stronger tendency to regulate common target genes and are typically more expressed compared to miRNAs unrelated to WGD events. Analyzing the role of ohno-miRNAs in the human gene regulatory network, we showed that ohno-miRNAs are statistically overrepresented in specific network motifs commonly associated with redundancy and complexity, highlighting their central role in gene regulation."

Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages which is prone to induce delays and biases. More recently, several authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most existing methods are either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. The analysis of wastewater samples has recently been pointed out as a valuable complementary approach to clinical sample analysis, however the pooled nature of the data involves specific statistical challenges. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations in a consistent way with lineages B.1.160, Alpha, B.1.177, Beta, and with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods (which track specific mutations over time) with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations."

    "content": "<p>by Michael P. Mustri, Quqiming Duan, Samraat Pawar</p>\n\nThe generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology for modeling the dynamics emerging from species interactions within complex ecological communities. The GLV is also increasingly being used to infer species interactions and predict dynamics from empirical data on microbial communities, in particular. However, despite its widespread use, the accuracy of the GLV\u2019s pairwise interaction structure in capturing the unseen dynamics of microbial consumer-resource interactions\u2014arising from resource competition and metabolite exchanges\u2014remains unclear. Here, we rigorously quantify how well the GLV can represent the dynamics of a general mathematical model that encapsulates key consumer-resource processes in microbial communities. We find that the GLV significantly misrepresents the feasibility, stability, and reactivity of microbial communities above a threshold biologically feasible level of consumer-resource coupling, because it omits higher-order nonlinear interactions. We show that the probability of the GLV making inaccurate predictions can be quantified by a simple, empirically accessible measure of timescale separation between consumers and resources. These insights advance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of resource-mediated microbial interactions and provide a method for gauging the GLV\u2019s reliability across various empirical and theoretical scenarios."

    "content": "<p>by Monica Sacco, Stefano Lancellotti, Antonietta Ferretti, Maria Basso, Leonardo Di Gennaro, Giancarlo Castaman, Raimondo De Cristofaro</p>\n\nType 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is often caused by variants in von Willebrand factor (VWF), including p.R1205H (\u201cVicenza mutation\u201d), which accelerate VWF clearance via macrophage receptor LRP1 and impair platelet adhesion and activation. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain partially unclear. Here, we use integrative computational modeling (I-TASSER, HADDOCK2.4, and PRODIGY) to predict how p.R1205H/C/L/S variants alter VWF interaction with LRP1 and its platelet receptor GPIb\u03b1 that binds to the A1 VWF domain. Our models reveal that R1205 acts as a structural hinge: its variants disrupt polar networks in VWF\u2019s D3 domain, exposing neo-epitopes that enhance LRP1 binding (\u0394\u0394G up to \u22125.3 kcal/mol) while destabilizing the A1 domain\u2019s \u03b11-\u03b22 loop, reducing GPIb\u03b1 affinity (\u224530-fold for R1205L/C). These findings explain clinical observations, p.R1205H rapid clearance yet retained platelet adhesion, and establish R1205 as a dual-functional switch regulating VWF circulatory lifetime and hemostatic activity. This analytical procedure provides a template for predicting pathogenicity of VWF variants and designing targeted therapies for VWD."

Recent studies have revealed the presence of distinct chromatin subcompartments beyond the traditional A/B compartments (eu- and hetero-chromatin), each exhibiting unique structural and functional properties. Here, we introduce TECSAS (Transformer of Epigenetics to Chromatin Structural AnnotationS), a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, designed to predict chromatin subcompartment annotations directly from epigenomic data. TECSAS leverages information from histone modifications, transcription factor binding profiles, and RNA-Seq data to decode the relationship between the biochemical composition of chromatin and its 3D structural behavior. TECSAS achieves high accuracy in predicting subcompartment annotations and reveals the influence of long-range epigenomic context on chromatin organization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to predict the association of loci with nuclear bodies, such as the lamina, nucleoli, and speckles, providing insights into the role of these structures in shaping the 3D genome organization. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models for deciphering the complex interplay between epigenomic features and 3D genome organization, allowing us to better understand genome structure and function."

Despite this, we know very little about this major group of eukaryotes. To establish a model organism for comprehensive investigation, we performed subcellular proteomics on <i>Paradiplonema papillatum</i> and localized 4,870 proteins to 22 cellular compartments. We additionally confirmed the predicted location of several proteins by epitope tagging and fluorescence microscopy. To probe the metabolic capacities of <i>P. papillatum</i>, we explored the proteins predicted to the cell membrane compartment in our subcellular proteomics dataset. Our data revealed an accumulation of many carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CDZymes). Our predictions suggest that these CDZymes are exposed to extracellular space, supporting proposals that diplonemids may specialize in breaking down carbohydrates in plant and algal cell walls. Further exploration of carbohydrate metabolism revealed an evolutionary divergence in the function of glycosomes (modified peroxisomes) in diplonemids versus kinetoplastids. Our subcellular proteome provides a resource for future investigations into the unique cell biology of diplonemids."

    "content": "The evolution of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signaling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity could also come with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell\u2019s baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviorally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies that may allow cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump\u2019s electrogenicity can open an additional axis of vulnerability that may play a role in brain disease."

    "content": "Daily choices are often influenced by environmental cues that are not directly associated with reinforcers. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be studied using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm involves the repeated pairing of two innocuous stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase in which one stimulus is associated with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The result is a conditioned response (e.g., freezing) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we successfully established a light\u2013tone sensory preconditioning task specifically in male mice, as sex differences were observed in both control experimental groups and in sensory preconditioning responses. We employed in vivo, freely moving fiber photometry to monitor neural activity in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus in male mice during the formation of associations between innocuous stimuli and reinforcers. Additionally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to investigate the roles of these hippocampal subregions in sensory preconditioning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive neurons are involved in encoding innocuous stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we developed a novel light\u2013tone sensory preconditioning protocol in male mice, enabling the detection of sex differences and furthering our understanding of how specific hippocampal subregions and cell types regulate complex cognitive processes."

    "content": "Abstract\nObservations show a fragile linear relationship between South Asian monsoon rainfall and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), reflecting their complex interactions. Our analysis reveals that both extreme positive and negative IOD (EXpIOD/EXnIOD) events could enhance rainfall over western South Asia during August\u2013September, even when ENSO signals are removed. This asymmetric influence arises from moisture convergence driven by anomalous winds. AGCM simulations indicate that EXpIOD\u2010related suppressed convection over the eastern pole induces a westward\u2010extended Gill\u2010type anticyclone, whose southwesterlies reinforce the background monsoon and promote orographic rainfall near the Western Ghats. Contrastingly, EXnIOD features an eastward\u2010shifted dipole; positive convection in the east drives a cyclonic circulation that transports Bay of Bengal moisture westward. This flow converges with cross\u2010equatorial southwesterlies generated by the western pole, enhancing rainfall over western India. These results suggest that the pattern asymmetry between EXpIOD and EXnIOD is a key factor that deserves consideration when assessing IOD\u2010monsoon interactions."

Solar\u2010induced fluorescence (SIF) is an increasingly well\u2010known and reliable indicator of vegetation health which captures rapid changes in how plants absorb and use light under stress. Recent efforts leveraging machine learning trained on spaceborne SIF and vegetation data from other sensors are producing seamless maps of SIF at spatial resolutions (\u223c5\u00a0km) aligned with land management needs. Three recent studies, Mohammadi et\u00a0al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2202767119), Parazoo et\u00a0al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108310), and Behera et\u00a0al.

This study investigates a barite BaSO4 $\\left(BaS{O}_{4}\\right)$ precipitation process that forms a thin, low\u2010permeability layer between parallel flows. Three\u2010dimensional core\u2010scale flooding experiments are conducted in Berea sandstone to induce internal transverse mixing and precipitation. X\u2010ray imaging, axial pressure drop observations, and core plugs extracted along the transverse direction characterize the spatial distribution of the precipitation and its effects on permeability. The transverse thickness of the resulting precipitation layer increases with axial (downstream) distance according to a (square\u2010root) power law. On the other hand, the reduction in (transverse) permeability within the precipitation layer is more severe near the injection sources. A high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional reactive transport model is reconciled with observations using an empirical porosity\u2010permeability relation. This understanding is foundational to furthering emerging methods for scale mitigation and the design of flow control strategies."

    "content": "Cell-cell communication networks govern tissue function in health and disease, but existing computational tools rely on static ligand-receptor databases and correlation-based analyses that cannot distinguish direct causal relationships from confounding or indirect associations. We introduce Cell-CLIP (Cellular Causal Learning and Inference Pipeline), a modular framework applying Pearl's causal discovery algorithms to infer directed cell program interaction networks from patient-level single-cell RNA-seq data. Cell-CLIP aggregates noisy single-cell expression into biologically interpretable cell program activity scores, then applies PC (constraint-based) and GES (score-based) causal discovery algorithms to learn directed acyclic graphs representing putative causal relationships. We applied Cell-CLIP to a 176-patient lung atlas (normal, COVID-19, adenocarcinoma) focusing on 14 universal cell programs active across all phenotypes. Hybrid consensus causal discovery (PC and GES union) identified 21 directed edges, yielding a sparse network (11.5% density) dominated by macrophage program hubs. Four edges discovered by both algorithms (Intersection consensus) agree with known biological knowledge, included well-validated biological mechanisms like: CD8/NK differentiation cascades, macrophage sensing-recruitment etc. Quantitative benchmarking against a 40-edge Pearson correlation baseline demonstrated Cell-CLIP's complementary advantages: while correlation showed low specificity (28% of edges truly causal) and sensitivity (52% recall of causal edges), Cell-CLIP achieved 100% specificity by eliminating spurious associations from confounding and indirect paths. Key methodological advances include: correction for confounding by rejecting spurious correlations, detection of masked direct effects via conditional independence testing, inference of causal directionality distinguishing sequential regulatory cascades from co-regulation, and generation of novel predictions for experimental validation. Cell-CLIP provides a hypothesis-generating framework for discovering candidate causal circuits in cell-cell communication that extends beyond correlation-based methods, though inferred relationships require experimental validation due to observational data limitations."

    "content": "The reliability of single-cell proteomics (SCP) is intrinsically linked to the fidelity of cell isolation; however, the identification of co-isolated cells (doublets or multiplets) remains a persistent challenge for single-cell (sc-) omics. While single-cell transcriptomics has established probabilistic frameworks for doublet detection, these methods are ill-suited for the sparser throughput of SCP datasets. This work presents scpImaging, a novel computational pipeline that repurposes the latent microscopy data routinely generated during cellenONE-based sample preparation to provide deterministic quality control (QC) and high-content phenotypic profiling. We demonstrate that standard proteomic quality metrics for SCP (e.g., peptide count, signal intensity) paradoxically favour retaining doublets. In contrast, scpImaging applies machine-learning-based cell segmentation (Cellpose-SAM) to identify and exclude these artefacts with high precision. Furthermore, the framework integrates morphological metrics generated using the open-source CellProfiler, with proteomic abundance data, enabling joint analysis that links cell shape and texture to molecular cell state. Provided as an open-source R package, scpImaging offers a scalable, automated solution for enhancing data integrity and adding a phenotypic dimension to SCP experiments without increasing experimental cost or complexity."

    "content": "Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are rapidly progressive and life-threatening diseases caused by diverse bacterial pathogens. While classical virulence factors such as toxins and secretion systems have been extensively characterized, the role of metabolic fitness in supporting bacterial survival within the nutrient-restricted host environment remains underexplored. Edwardsiella tarda, a human-pathogenic bacterium implicated in NSTIs, represents an emerging model for studying non-canonical pathogenic strategies. Here, we employed transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify genes critical for E. tarda survival in a murine soft tissue infection model. A genome-wide screen revealed 41 genes significantly depleted during the infection, including those involved in iron and zinc acquisition (fetB, zupT), vitamin biosynthesis (pdxK, cobA), and polyamine metabolism (speB). Functional assays using defined minimal media demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin B6 or putrescine enhanced bacterial growth, validating their contribution to fitness under nutrient-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that E. tarda pathogenesis is driven not solely by classical virulence factors but also by its ability to acquire essential nutrients and adapt metabolically to host-imposed nutritional stress. This study provides the first genome-wide fitness map for E. tarda during soft tissue infection and reveals new targets for therapeutic intervention that disrupt nutrient acquisition systems. These results also emphasize the broader relevance of metabolic adaptation as a determinant of virulence in invasive bacterial infections."

    "content": "Warming temperatures are accelerating permafrost thaw and changing tundra vegetation, where woody shrubs are displacing sedges. Shrubs, such as Betula nana, and sedges, such as Eriophorum vaginatum, exhibit distinct life strategies including unique root-associated, or rhizosphere microbial communities. As permafrost thaws it unlocks previously unavailable carbon and nutrient sources resulting in deeper roots and a translocation of rhizosphere communities. Because permafrost microbial communities contain lower diversity and biomass than rhizosphere communities, the coalescence of rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities could alter soil organic matter (SOM) degradation rates and increase greenhouse gas emissions. To identify metabolic strategies across distinct rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities we conducted an isotope tracing incubation experiment. We inoculated thawed permafrost with shrub and sedge rhizosphere communities while adding exudates or water daily and compared this to an uninoculated control. After 46 days, we spiked samples with 18O enriched water or 13C enriched exudates and measured isotope incorporation into microbial DNA with quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). Our results indicate that exudate additions had little effect on uninoculated permafrost communities but the addition of exudates and rhizosphere inoculants had a compounding effect on respiration rates. We found that soils inoculated with shrub rhizosphere communities contained a mixture of exudate and SOM degraders while soils inoculated with sedge rhizosphere communities contained mainly SOM degraders. Finally, we found that individual microbial taxa exhibited maximum growth rates in one environment, which was a combination of microbial inoculant communities and exudate addition treatments. Our results reveal that microbial niches are strongly influenced by substrate preferences and community context, and suggest that a reduction in sedges and an expansion of shrubs may provide a mechanism by which permafrost carbon losses are mitigated through corresponding shifts in microbial communities and their substrate preferences."

Mutualism breakdown is a pressing challenge to examine this intersection, as shifts in diverse microbial communities might coincide with evolutionary changes in mutualistic traits within a key species. Here we study the legume-rhizobium mutualism after 33 years of nitrogen fertilization. Pairing manipulative inoculation studies with long-read amplicon sequencing provides unprecedented resolution across biological scales: whole bacterial community, genus Rhizobium, individual Rhizobium ASVs, and symbiosis plasmids. Clover host plants in N-fertilized plots encounter microbial communities depauperate in their preferred symbiont but enriched in other Rhizobium taxa; moreover, their symbiotic nodules house low-quality symbiosis plasmids. Thus, concurrent ecological and evolutionary shifts make mutualists both rarer and inferior and feed back to decrease the benefits hosts receive from mutualism."

Within the mosquito midgut, malaria parasite gametes are activated and undergo fertilisation. If parasite fertilisation is perturbed, this stops the transmission of malaria parasites from mosquito to human. One proposed target of transmission-blocking interventions is Plasmodium falciparum fusogen PfHAP2, which is essential for gamete fusion during parasite fertilisation. However, to date, no monoclonal antibodies or structures of PfHAP2 have been generated. We have identified nanobodies that bind specifically to domain 3 of PfHAP2 with nanomolar affinities, two of which show some cross-species reactivity with HAP2 of other Plasmodium species. The crystal structure of one nanobody in complex with domain 3 of PfHAP2 provides the first structural insights into this transmission-blocking target in P. falciparum."

In this study, the effects of soil quality and microbial diversity in the field bulk soil and rhizosphere on the development of postharvest diseases were investigated. Microbial genera in bulk soil and rhizosphere samples were identified by Illumina Miseq amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S and fungal ITS regions. Disease symptoms in the stored carrots were monitored after six months of cold storage, and the main pathogens were identified. The field sites with mineral soils, which had a higher pH, had a higher bacterial and fungal diversity than organic soils. The organically managed fields had a higher bacterial diversity than the conventionally managed fields. Community structure of both bacteria and fungi was largely driven by field site including its main chemical characteristics, with rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from the same site displaying comparable assemblages. Higher soil microbial diversity was associated with higher postharvest storability in the stored carrots. The weather during the growing season also had an effect on the observed fungal biodiversity, which was higher at sites that had lower temperatures and less rain prior to harvest."

    "content": "Bacteriophages (phages) are well known to be one of the major driving forces in bacterial evolution. This also applies to virulent microorganisms, such as the major human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, whose pathogenic potential and epidemic proliferation largely depends on the interaction with environmental phages. Specifically, integration of the CTXphi; phage genome into the first chromosome of V. cholerae also introduced the ctxAB genes, encoding the primary toxin responsible for the severe acute diarrheal disease, cholera. Whereas the mechanisms underlying CTXphi-associated horizontal gene transfer and transcriptional control of the ctxAB genes have been intensively studied over the past years, post-transcriptional regulation affecting the CTXphi life-cycle has not been documented. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the CisR small RNA (sRNA) that is produced from the 3UTR (untranslated region) of the prtV gene and inhibits the expression of the CTXphi-encoded cep mRNA. CisR-mediated repression of cep involves Hfq-assisted base-pairing of the two transcripts and results in reduced CTXphi production under stress conditions. We further demonstrate that transcription of prtV-cisR requires both the master quorum-sensing regulator HapR and CRP, a global regulator of carbon metabolism. Taken together, our work provides evidence that V. cholerae employs sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation to coordinate CTXphi activation with both cell density and nutrient availability."

Here, we determine in-situ near-atomic structures of the sheathed flagellar motor inside intact cells. The motor anchors to the outer membrane through lipidated HL-rings without forming a membrane pore, thereby allowing axial assembly to drive sheath formation. Conserved LP-rings act as slide-rotary bushings that permit high-speed rotation within a dynamic envelope yet can constrict to seal the pore upon stress-induced ejection. We further show that stator activation requires a specific PomB-MotX interaction rather than peptidoglycan engagement. Together, these findings reveal how the distinctive architecture and dynamics of the sheathed flagellum promote V. cholerae motility, environmental survival, and persistent colonization of the human gut."

    "content": "Members of the bacterial phylum Bacteroidota inhabit a wide range of ecosystems. Although significant progress has been made over the past decade in understanding the metabolic functions of clinically relevant Bacteroidota, far less is known about the environmental species. Despite being one of the dominant phyla linked to crops, there is limited information on the mechanisms that enable Bacteroidota to thrive in plant and soil environments. A key obstacle in understanding gene fitness in Bacteroidota is the lack of genome-wide functional studies, largely due to their inherent resistance to antibiotics, which complicates genetic manipulation. In this study, we used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to measure gene fitness in a plant-associated Bacteroidota, Mucilaginibacter yixingensis YX-36. Our data sheds light on pathways involved in rhizosphere colonization, gliding motility, stress tolerance, and carbon metabolism. Notably, we found that phylum-specific genes such as Polysaccharide Utilization Loci (PULs) and Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) are needed for fitness in the plant niche. Overall, this work advances our understanding of gene functions in environmental Bacteroidota species and provides a foundation for future research on their roles in plant-microbe interactions."

Here, we explored the microbial and glycobiological connectivity between the sea surface microlayer (SML), the underlying seawater (ULW), snow, and aerosol particles in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, 79N) during autumn and spring. The marked overlap between marine and atmospheric microbiomes illustrates considerable sea-air transfer, linked to seasonally distinct environmental communities. For instance, Polaribacter and Formosa were aerosolized during the spring bloom, compared to Colwellia in autumn. Air-mass trajectories and microbial source tracking revealed a greater marine contribution in autumn, whereas spring aerosols were shaped by stronger winds and the cryosphere. Aerosol particles nonetheless contained numerous unique taxa, including Actinobacteria likely originating from terrestrial sources. Linking bacterial, microeukaryotic, carbohydrate, and meteorological dynamics established an overarching perspective across seasons and habitats, identifying four distinct ecosystem states. Genome-sequenced bacterial model isolates, representing key environmental populations, encode adaptive traits such as carotenoid and ectoine biosynthesis, supporting survival in the SML and atmospheric transfer. Comparison with time-series records from the nearby Fram Strait revealed that many aerosolized bacteria are consistent microbiome components; with implications for ecology and biogeochemistry across the wider Arctic."

Transient NO2- accumulation is common but varies among bacteria. Despite its potential toxicity and its role in NO and N2O emissions, the regulatory mechanisms governing NO2- accumulation remain poorly understood. We profiled eighteen closely related Stutzerimonas strains, including the model S. perfectomarina ZoBell, and identified three phenotypic clusters (full, partial and low nitrite accumulators; FNA, PNA and LNA) based on the fraction of NO3--N transiently accumulated as NO2-. FNA and PNA strains carry both periplasmic (NapA) and membrane-bound (NarG) NO3- reductases. FNA strains carry the nitrite reductase NirS clade 1b and NirTB, potentially regulating nirS, while PNA strains carry NirS clade 1a and lack NirTB. FNA showed delayed transcription of nirS when NO3- was present, likely explaining its NO2- accumulation phenotype. LNA strains lack narG or express it late, balancing NO2- production. Addition of NO3- halted NO2- reduction in FNA but not in others, indicating metabolic control beyond transcription. Our findings reveal diverse NO2--handling phenotypes among denitrifiers and provide insights for optimizing wastewater nitrogen removal and soil bioaugmentation strategies to mitigate N2O emissions."

While mass spectrometry-coupled ribosome profiling of the mesophilic methanoarchaeon Methanosarcina mazei has recently unveiled a wealth of novel small ORFs, the functional roles of most of their products remain unknown. Here, we report the characterization of MttQ (98 aa) and MttS (49 aa), products of small ORFs situated in an operon alongside genes encoding a drug-metabolite-efflux (DME) family transporter (mttP) and other enzymes involved in trimethylamine (TMA) degradation. MttS and MttQ interact with MttP to form a stable oligomeric complex spanning the cytoplasmic membrane. TMA transport activity of the MttQ/MttS/MttP-complex is demonstrated via in vivo Escherichia coli cells heterologously expressing this system. Based on the reduced growth of a M. mazei mutant lacking mttS, on TMA as sole carbon source, we conclude that MttS governs the specificity of TMA transport. We posit that interactions between a DME transporter, e.g., MttP, and small proteins fueled evolution of the MttPQS complex and the advent of selective TMA uptake in methylotrophic methanoarchaea. These findings suggest an evolutionary mechanism on how small accessory proteins can alter conserved core functions in order to explore new ecological niches. Further, given that TMA levels in the human bloodstream influence cardiovascular disease risk but can be degraded by host-associated methanoarchaea containing a homolog of the MttPQS-complex, our findings present insight into an archaeal pathway with relevance to human health."

To investigate how these abiotic stressors interact with viral infection, we analyzed the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans acclimated to simulated microgravity (G) and below-background muon radiation flux (BBR), upon infection with Orsay virus (OrV). Using RNA-seq, we characterized gene expression profiles across single and combined stress conditions. Both G and BBR elicited distinct stress responses, including modulation of oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and immune pathways. OrV infection alone induced robust transcriptional changes, but its impact was significantly attenuated when combined with either abiotic stress, suggesting antagonistic interactions. Notably, proviral genes such as drl-1, fat-7 and hipr-1 were downregulated under BBR and G, potentially impairing viral replication. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment in immune effectors, RNA metabolism, and proteostasis-related pathways, particularly under BBR. Viral load and RNA2/RNA1 ratios were reduced in both stress conditions, indicating a shift in viral replication dynamics. Moreover, genomic diversity and defective viral genome formation were differentially affected, with increased genetic diversity and structural variation under stress. These findings suggest that acclimation to off-Earth conditions primes the host for a dampened response to an acute viral infection, potentially through resource reallocation and transcriptional attenuation. This study provides transcriptomic insight into viral infection under space-relevant conditions, highlighting complex stress interactions and their implications for host-pathogen dynamics in extraterrestrial environ-ments."

Their robustness and adaptability make them relevant not only to terrestrial ecosystems but also to astrobiological exploration. As durable entities, they may persist in environments far harsher than those tolerable to cellular life and are likely candidates for forward contamination. To assess their relevance in planetary protection and as potential biomarkers, we investigated the preservation of bacteriophage Qb, an RNA virus, in Mars analog environments using two commercial Martian regolith simulants: MGS-1 and MMS-2. MMS-2, enriched in iron oxides, exhibited higher oxidative potential than MGS-1, which is mainly composed of basaltic material. Viral survival was assessed across variables including time, temperature, concentration, and particle size. Our results show that inactivation in MGS-1 was primarily driven by adsorption, while in MMS-2 it was dominated by chemical oxidation. MGS-1 provided a more protective matrix, mitigating freeze-induced damage and shielding desiccated viral particles from UV-B and UV-C radiation. These findings highlight the importance of mineral composition in modulating viral persistence and suggest that regolith may act as both a barrier and a refuge. Understanding virus mineral interactions is essential for assessing biosignature preservation, planetary protection, and the potential roles of viruses in the evolution and survival of life beyond Earth."

Among these, the NEL family E3 ubiquitin ligases (SlrP, SspH1, and SspH2) are known to modulate immune signaling, but the breadth of their impact on the host ubiquitylome remains unexplored. In this study, we have performed a global proteomic analysis to identify host proteins ubiquitylated in response to expression of these three effectors in human cells. Using enrichment strategies combined with mass spectrometry under conditions where the proteasome is active or not, we identified 214 putative substrates of ubiquitylation. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeleton organization, chromatin remodeling, and vesicular trafficking. In vitro ubiquitylation assays validated five novel substrates and revealed differential substrate specificity and patterns of ubiquitin chain topology among the effectors. Notably, expression of SspH1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupted polysome profiles in a ligase activity dependent manner, indicating a direct impact of the bacterial effector on translation of eukaryotic cells. Comparison with previously published global interactomes and ubiquitylomes supports a model in which Salmonella NEL effectors subvert a broader range of host pathways through targeted ubiquitylation. Our findings uncover new roles for NEL ubiquitin ligases in host manipulation and provide a holistic analysis of their effects on the ubiquitylome of the host cell, constituting a valuable resource for the study of bacterial pathogenesis and infection biology."

It is caused by several lyssaviruses and leads to an encephalitis, which is 100% fatal after symptom onset. The most common cause of rabies is the rabies virus (RABV), which leads to around 59,000 human deaths globally every year. The infection leads to drastic changes in host behaviour, but the underlying mechanistic details remain unclear. Although interactions between the viral glycoprotein and host nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been proposed as drivers of rabies-associated neurological dysfunction, clinical proteomic studies in naturally infected canines have been partially explored. In this study, we conducted a global proteomics analysis of RABV-infected and non-infected canine brain samples in India to unravel the changes in protein expression. Using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, we identified various host proteins and pathways dysregulated in the infected state. Approximately 700 proteins exhibited differential expression, with around 250 proteins involved in various pathways being significantly upregulated and approximately 500 proteins being significantly downregulated in the infected condition. Network clustering of the dysregulated proteins revealed functional modules, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin cytoskeletal regulation, and the TCA cycle, indicating widespread alterations in cellular trafficking, energy metabolism, and structural integrity. Complementary pathway enrichment through PANTHER identified processes linked to axon guidance, integrin signalling, chemokine and cytokine-mediated inflammation, and cytoskeletal regulation, underscoring the profound impact of rabies virus infection on neuronal connectivity and host immune responses"

    "content": "Extraction of high-quality RNA from microbial samples, especially complex microbiomes like the gut, remains a significant challenge. The instability of RNA, coupled with the abundance of RNases and difficult-to-lyse microbial cells, often results in degraded or low-yield RNA, hampering downstream applications. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we developed a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and efficient microbial RNA extraction method, which is equally effective for pure cultures and complex microbiomes. The method utilises low pH (4.7) and high temperature to lyse the cells, followed by rapid cooling to induce misfolded renaturation of genomic DNA and proteins. During the phase separation step, RNA remains in the aqueous phase and is subsequently precipitated using chilled isopropanol. The RNA suspended in double-distilled water (pH 6.5) remained stable for six months at -20 degree C. Further, we compared amplicon microbiome profiles generated from metagenomic DNA and cDNA (synthesised from extracted meta-RNA) derived from the broiler gut, taken as a model system. Our findings reveal that the cDNA-based amplicon microbiome composition more accurately deciphers the metabolically active population in gut environments that aligns with culture-based enumeration of viable microbes. This proof-of-concept study underscores the importance of meta-RNA approaches for functional microbiome analysis and provides a reliable RNA isolation method that can be broadly adopted for studies aiming to resolve active microbial community structure."

Those functions are largely dependent on the presence of highly adapted biological communities, for which, their microbial communities remain understudied. Our goal is to describe the bacterial communities across the groundwater-dependent ecosystems on Lanzarote, spanning a gradient of anthropogenic pollution using 16SrRNA amplicon sequencing. We sampled coastal caves and pools, wells and water galleries, springs, saltworks and marine bays affected by submarine groundwater discharge. Ecological analyses highlight that richness and composition of bacterial communities strongly depend on the type of habitats. Pathogens and human-derived species were ubiquitous in our samples, but, strikingly, caves and wells were strongly enriched with them compared to other habitats. We propose that our results highlight the susceptibility of groundwater environments to pollution and indicate that aquifers act as reservoirs of biological contamination in addition to natural diversity, regardless of their salinity. Since this enrichment might compromise some of the functions and services that groundwater-dependent ecosystems provide in oceanic islands, we call for integrative conservation strategies that include hydrological and biological perspectives into the decision making."

This study collected data on tobacco seedlings during the sowing and transplanting periods in the southwestern region of China, combined with altitude gradient data of the planting area. Time series analysis was used to construct a tobacco seedling sowing period estimation model and establish an application platform. The model was validated by comparing the survival rate of transplanting. The results indicate that the proposed LSTM model has an R2 of 0.893, a MAE of 1.796, an RSME of 2.221, and a validation model accuracy of 93.3%. The research results provide scientific sowing time basis for tobacco growers in different altitude regions, and results provide scientific sowing time basis for tobacco growers in different altitude regions, and offer suggestions for optimizing tobacco planting management and promoting the sustainable development of the tobacco industry."

    "content": "A key challenge in ecosystem-based fisheries management is sustainably harvesting co-occurring species and populations that differ in their vulnerability to fishing. This challenge is exemplified in western Alaska Chinook salmon, where recent population declines have led to closures of in-river subsistence fisheries, but identifying the cause of these declines is limited by an inability to identify the river of origin for marine-caught fish in offshore fisheries that target more abundant species and populations. This problem is particularly acute for estimating the impacts of bycatch on individual salmon populations which have demographic independence but no genetic differentiation from which stock assignments can be made. Here we use machine learning approaches to assess the efficacy of using the microchemical history preserved in fish otoliths to assign individuals to their river of origin in western Alaska. We tested the classification ability of three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) combined with two time series smoothing techniques (Moving Average and Generalized Additive Models) to classify Chinook salmon to their river of origin using otolith time series data. Model accuracy ranged from 71.9% to 92.5%, with optimal performance achieved by Random Forest applied to GAM-smoothed data. Watershed-specific performance ranged from 86.8% to 93.7%, with most misclassifications occurring between spatially proximate Kuskokwim and Nushagak rivers. Raw predicted probabilities from classification algorithms were calibrated to reflect true class probabilities, enabling the incorporation of model results into decision analyses with explicit consideration of misclassification risk tolerance. The success of these models offers immediate utility for estimating marine mortality impacts across the region's three major river systems as well as an opportunity to understand commercial fisheries impacts on individual populations at substantially finer spatial scales than had been previously possible."

    "content": "As climate change accelerates, coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly exposed to co-occurring stressors whose combined effects are nonlinear and difficult to predict. Deoxygenation is a rapidly intensifying yet underrecognized threat to coral reefs that interacts with heat and acidification to alter coral physiology and stress resilience. However, the effects of hypoxia-related compound events on corals are largely unknown, underscoring the need for multi-stressor studies. Here, we conducted two extended-exposure experiments (12-17 days) across the coral species Porites furcata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, to disentangle the individual and combined effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) with either heat or acidification. We measured eight phenotypic traits related to growth, metabolism, and symbiosis health to test whether hypoxia imposes energetic constraints or other physiological stress that amplify the effects of heat or acidification. Standardized effect size analysis across 24 stressor-trait combinations revealed 13 additive, 10 synergistic, and only one antagonistic response. Hypoxia consistently suppressed dark respiration by 37-49% across species and altered photophysiology in the two Porites species, whereas acidification alone had minimal effects, particularly in S. siderea. Heat stress caused the most pronounced declines across nearly all traits, and when combined with hypoxia, it produced the highest number of synergistic interactions. In contrast, the combination of hypoxia and acidification largely resulted in additive responses, suggesting that independent physiological mechanisms underlie these effects. All corals showed strong metabolic depression under hypoxia which is likely beneficial as a short-term adaptive response but may impose energetic constraints in the long-term. These findings highlight deoxygenation as critical yet often overlooked drivers of coral reef vulnerability. More multi-stressor experiments across a range of species are urgently needed to improve predictions of reef resilience under future ocean conditions, where compound stress events are expected to become more frequent and severe."

    "content": "Incorporating metacommunity perspectives into bioassessment represents a major challenge in the management of drying river networks, where drying-induced fragmentation compromises the performance of biological indices to assess their ecological status. Indeed, current indices focus on local community responses to stressors and neglect the effect of regional processes, such as spatiotemporal connectivity and dispersal, on metacommunity assembly. In this work, we explored the effect of drying on the performance of a widely used biological index using metacommunity simulations on a synthetic drying river network. We assessed how different gradients of drying-driven fragmentation and human impact extent determine local richness and the biological index scores by combining simulations with biomonitoring information. We used a coalescent metacommunity model to simulate the exchange of individuals between local communities along synthetic drying river networks. These networks were subjected to different drying extent, drying intensity and human impact extent scenarios. Additionally, we considered two major characteristics for each simulated taxon: (i) tolerance to human impacts and (ii) dispersal strategy (flying, swimming, or drifting). For each simulation, we obtained local richness and the biological index value. Then, we calculated biological index performance, which we defined as the capacity to distinguish between impacted and non-impacted sites. Finally, we tested our approach in six non-impacted European drying river networks, from which drying information was available. Our results showed that low spatiotemporal connectivity consistently led to decreased local richness and low scores of the biological index (reflecting poor biological quality). As drying extent and intensity increased, drying-induced fragmentation significantly reduced the biological index performance. For example, with a 50% increase in drying extent, index performance fell over 70% and at high drying levels, this performance dropped more than 90%. This decay followed a convex pattern, with a marked drop in performance as soon as drying appeared in the catchment and leveling off at higher drying extents. Synthesis and applications: We show how simulations can be used to incorporate network fragmentation and metacommunity dynamics into the design and validation of biomonitoring tools, thereby increasing their efficiency."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/10.64898/2025.12.01.691502v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Estuaries are ecologically vital yet highly impacted ecosystems that serve as transitional zones between land and sea. Monitoring their biodiversity is essential but challenging due to their dynamic nature and the transient presence of many species. Traditionally actinopterygian monitoring in these systems still relies on conventional and intrusive methods such as gill nets and trawls. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a non-invasive, multi-taxa alternative that can complement these traditional approaches. Here, we applied an eDNA-based metabarcoding approach to characterize vertebrate diversity in the Rance Estuary, located in the Brittany Region of France. Water samples were collected from five stations spanning marine to freshwater environments. Special attention was given to two stations located upstream and downstream of the tidal power plant (TPP) dam to assess its potential impact on ecological continuity. We detected a total of 124 distinct vertebrate MOTUs, comprising actinopterygians, birds, mammals, and amphibians. Taxonomic composition followed the estuarine gradient, with Jaccard dissimilarity increasing with distance from the sea and largely driven by species turnover. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity remained relatively stable across the vertebrate community, functional diversity revealed an increasing terrestrial influence. For actinopterygians, taxonomic diversity decreased upstream, whereas phylogenetic and functional diversity indicated fine-scale structuring, even among nearby stations. This approach enabled the development of biodiversity metrics and facilitated comparisons with previous actinopterygian monitoring surveys in the same area based on conventional methods (scientific fishing using nets and dredges). Our results emphasise the potential of eDNA for holistic estuarine biomonitoring and establish a valuable baseline for future non-invasive assessments."

To align with its National Food Security Plan, Iran aims to reduce agricultural water consumption by 30 billion m3 by 2032 (3) with smart irrigation (SI) technology that uses data and, in some cases, sensors to adjust watering, reduce waste, and enhance water productivity (4). SI would also use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze data, make predictions of future environmental conditions, and better manage the supply for crops. Despite its potential, this plan is likely to fail in Iran\u2019s smallholder farming context, wasting public resources and undermining efforts to improve water and food security."

    "content": "Abstract\nLarge amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are transported laterally from uplands and wetlands to headwater streams; however, the global magnitude of this flux and its role in the carbon (C) budget remain unclear. By compiling 20,403 DOC concentration observations and applying machine learning models, we estimated the annual DOC flux from forested headwater streams north of 30\u00b0S to be 116.2\u00a0Tg\u00a0C\u00a0yr\u22121 (90% CI: 86.5\u2013145.2). Higher yields were observed in tropical regions (3.8\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121), where vegetation productivity is high, and in boreal regions (3.1\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121), where peatland cover and soil organic C stocks are substantial. When comparing our results with global terrestrial C flux estimates upscaled from eddy covariance data, we found that the fraction of net ecosystem production (NEP) lost annually as DOC ranged from negligible (<0.1%) to 20.7%, with discharge explaining 34% of the variation. Our study suggests that neglecting the lateral export of DOC could lead to an overestimation of NEP in forested headwater catchments, a bias that is further amplified by increased discharge."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe southwest Pacific Ocean (SWPO), located on the western side of the South Pacific subtropical gyre, has exhibited a notable trend of subsurface freshening over the past several decades. Using observation\u2010based ocean salinity data sets, we find that SWPO subsurface freshening has slowed in the most recent three decades (1990\u20132020), to a rate less than one\u2010fourth of that observed during the prior three decades (1960\u20131990). To understand the drivers of this subsurface salinity variability, we conduct surface forcing perturbation experiments using a global ocean\u2010sea ice model, specifically targeting the distinct impacts of changes in surface heat, freshwater, and momentum (wind stress) fluxes. Our study reveals that the subsurface freshening slowdown in the SWPO since the 1990s is largely (75%) attributed to a weakened poleward shift of the westerly winds. This shift induces isopycnal deepening, enhanced poleward Ekman transport, and subsequent subduction of saltier subtropical surface waters into the ocean interior. Surface heat fluxes also contribute to these to a lesser extent (37%) via the spiciness component, as surface cooling at high latitudes shifts isopycnal outcrops equatorward, enabling saltier surface waters to be subducted; these effects are partly offset by freshwater fluxes (\u221212%). Further analysis suggests that these surface flux changes are at least partly linked to a multidecadal shift in the interdecadal Pacific oscillation around 1990. The mechanisms identified in this study strengthen our understanding of how ocean interior salinity responds to large\u2010scale climate variability and provide insights for better detecting and quantifying the intensification of the global water cycle."

    "content": "Using image analysis to track the development of fungal networks in the presence of predators, we found that even in modular organisms, plasticity is more nuanced and limited than previously assumed. Our results challenge the long\u2010held notion that a modular body plan necessarily confers extreme plasticity.\n\nABSTRACT\nModular organisms such as fungi are assumed to exhibit extreme morphological plasticity, yet this assumption has rarely been tested experimentally. Their morphology emerges from local, independent responses of constituent modules, suggesting strong plastic responses to environmental conditions. While such levels of plasticity decouple morphology from ecological function, they make these organisms an ideal system for studying the evolution of plasticity. Here we quantified the plasticity of modular fungi to grazers with known strong effects on their fitness and tested two competing hypotheses: (1) fungal morphology converges on a common \u2018grazing\u2010resistant\u2019 phenotype across species (i.e., extreme plasticity) or (2) grazer\u2010induced plasticity remains limited and species\u2010specific. We found support for the latter, suggesting a more nuanced plasticity for fungi than would be expected based on their modularity. Our study calls for refining assumptions about plasticity in modular organisms and informs the use of morphological traits as predictors of ecological function."

    "content": "We discovered a spatial mosaic of two unique integrations of grasshopper plasticity (behavioural, physiological) that corresponded to mean diel maximum temperatures. Cool and Warm site grasshoppers both altered their canopy height and metabolism in response to experimental warming, but in opposite ways depending on spider predation risk. These unique plastic responses had divergent cascading effects on Solidago, the competitively dominant plant in this system.\n\nABSTRACT\nPrevailing views hold that species' physiological plasticity may confer resilience to warming, but its importance varies across climatic gradients (e.g., latitude). Yet, along such gradients local species populations may experience fine\u2010scale spatially heterogenous variation in extreme temperatures and other ecological stressors. We show that at four Cool (mean diel maximum 29.83\u00b0C) and four Warm (mean diel maximum 31.51\u00b0C) sites, interspersed as a spatial mosaic throughout a 26,200\u2009km2 area, local herbivore populations responded differently to stress from experimental warming (ambient, warmed) and predation (presence, absence). Cool and Warm site herbivore populations utilised different combinations of behavioural and physiological plasticity to cope with the dual stressors that were contingent on local temperature extremes. These unique plastic responses had divergent cascading effects on the plant community. Our results suggest that increased attention to local population variation can enhance the ability to predict the fate of natural communities under environmental change."

These systems are embedded in ecologically complex landscapes, central to global food security, and depend heavily on biodiversity\u2010derived ecosystem services. We conducted a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of 35 studies assessing the relationship between distance to natural habitat and pollinator abundance, species richness, and crop fruit set in tropical smallholder farms. We found no consistent patterns in pollinator abundance and crop fruit set with increasing distance, with relationships highly variable across studies. Similarly variable, yet slightly negative, was the relationship between distance and pollinator species richness. Our findings suggest limited support for the \u2018proximity to natural habitat\u2019 hypothesis in tropical smallholder farms, indicating that the inherent complexity of these landscapes may buffer negative effects of distance on pollination. This underscores the importance of maintaining and restoring landscape complexity to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services such as crop pollination. We also highlight the need for greater methodological consistency and publicly available raw data in future studies to strengthen the evidence base and support management strategies for safeguarding pollination services in tropical smallholder farms."

    "content": "Human\u2010induced habitat fragmentation threatens connectivity for populations of wide\u2010ranging species by compromising long\u2010distance dispersal. We evaluated movement\u2010based resource selection of dispersing mountain lions (Puma concolor) to identify specific landscape conditions influencing movement decisions and connectivity between populations across the US state of California. Our results elucidate how anthropogenic features inhibit dispersal at the statewide scale, as mountain lions avoided development more strongly as both the area of and building density within developed patches increased. Furthermore, dispersing mountain lions strongly avoided crossing roadways but exhibited relaxed avoidance in areas where vegetative cover was present on both sides of the road. Importantly, mountain lions selected even relatively small patches of natural habitat, which may function as stepping\u2010stones promoting movement through otherwise unsuitable habitat. We provide empirical evidence linking genetic structure suggestive of reduced connectivity to underlying behavioral mechanisms. Understanding behavior during dispersal is fundamental to conserving connectivity between and viability of populations persisting within fragmented landscapes\u2014and to facilitate recolonization of historical ranges."

    "content": "<p>by Mengxiang Lin, Rongqi Fan, Saisai Zhu, Xiaoqiang Yan, Quan Zou, Zhen Tian</p>\n\nCancer\u2019s heterogeneity necessitates precise subtype identification for effective diagnosis and treatment, which can be achieved by integrating multi-omics data to reveal distinct molecular characteristics and enable personalized therapies. Recently, significant efforts have been made through contrastive clustering methods to efficiently identify cancer subtypes. However, existing approaches remain limited in effectively capturing inter- and intra-view relationships in multi-omics data. Additionally, most cancer subtyping methods often rely on random sampling to construct negative pairs, which may inadvertently engender false negatives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning model named Decoupled Contrastive Multi-view Clustering with adaptive false negative elimination (DCMC). Specifically, DCMC adopts a multi-view clustering architecture that facilitates intra- and inter-view contrastive learning across distinct embedding spaces, allowing view-specific information to be preserved while maintaining cross-view consistency. We further introduce an adaptive false negative elimination framework to progressively screen potential false negatives. Finally, pseudo-label rectification is applied to enhance the quality of the learned representations and further refine the clustering process. DCMC is evaluated on 10 commonly used cancer datasets against 19 state-of-the-art methods, with experimental results validating its superior performance. In the Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma case study, differential expression analysis is performed to identify potential biomarkers, while the cancer subtypes identified by DCMC are validated for their responses to specific therapeutic drugs. The datasets and source code for DCMC are available online at https://github.com/LinMengX/DCMC."

    "content": "<p>by Dylan J. Morris, Lauren Kennedy, Andrew J. Black</p>\n\nMechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus\u2019 biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method for this class of models by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals."

    "content": "<p>by Tianyu Xie, Yicong Mao, Cheng Zhang</p>\n\nProbabilistic modeling over the combinatorially large space of tree topologies remains a central challenge in phylogenetic inference. Previous approaches often necessitate pre-sampled tree topologies, limiting their modeling capability to a subset of the entire tree space. A recent advancement is ARTree, a deep autoregressive model that offers unrestricted distributions for tree topologies. However, its reliance on repetitive tree traversals and inefficient local message passing for computing topological node representations may hamper the scalability to large datasets. This paper proposes ARTreeFormer, a novel approach that harnesses fixed-point iteration and attention mechanisms to accelerate ARTree. By introducing a fixed-point iteration algorithm for computing the topological node embeddings, ARTreeFormer allows fast vectorized computation, especially on CUDA devices. This, together with an attention-based global message passing scheme, significantly improves the computation speed of ARTree while maintaining great approximation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on a benchmark of challenging real data phylogenetic inference problems."

    "content": "<p>by Gaurav S. Athreya, Chaitanya S. Gokhale, Prateek Verma</p>\n\nThe coexistence of diverse microbial communities despite the common presence of antimicrobial weapons presents a fundamental puzzle in ecology. To address this issue, we investigate the role of antibiotic-mediated interactions in driving microbial diversity using methods from graph theory and theoretical ecology. Our exhaustive analysis of small interaction graphs involving antibiotic production, resistance, and degradation reveals that two factors together determine whether an interaction pattern can support coexistence or not: a certain producer-sensitive-degrader (PSD) motif is critical, and a form of cyclicity between the action of different antibiotics is necessary. Using individual-based simulations, we also explore the role of the PSD motif in spatially structured populations and demonstrate that community coexistence is robust over a wide range of antibiotic and degrader diffusivities. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the interaction patterns that drive diversity in complex microbial communities. Specifically, we emphasize how antagonism does not preclude biodiversity. These results offer clear pathways for cultivating synthetic microbial consortia, enabling the design of more effective strategies for manipulating microbial communities."

    "content": "<p>by Obadiah J. Mulder, Maya Peters Kostman, Abdulrahmen Almodaimegh, Michael D. Edge, Joseph W. Larkin</p>\n\nMicrobes of nearly every species can form biofilms, communities of cells bound together by a self-produced matrix. It is not understood how variation at the cellular level impacts putatively beneficial, colony-level behaviors, such as cell-to-cell signaling. Here we investigate this problem with an agent-based computational model of metabolically driven electrochemical signaling in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilms. In this process, glutamate-starved interior cells release potassium, triggering a depolarizing wave that spreads to exterior cells and limits their glutamate uptake. More nutrients diffuse to the interior, temporarily reducing glutamate stress and leading to oscillations. In our model, each cell has a membrane potential coupled to metabolism. As a simulated biofilm grows, collective membrane potential oscillations arise spontaneously as cells deplete nutrients and trigger potassium release, reproducing experimental observations. We further validate our model by comparing spatial signaling patterns and cellular signaling rates with those observed experimentally. By oscillating external glutamate and potassium, we find that biofilms synchronize to external potassium, providing a potential mechanism for previously observed oscillation synchronization. By tracking cellular glutamate concentrations, we find that oscillations evenly distribute nutrients in space: non-oscillating biofilms have an external layer of well-fed cells surrounding a starved core, whereas oscillating biofilms exhibit a relatively uniform distribution of glutamate. Our work shows the potential of agent-based models to connect cellular properties to collective phenomena and facilitates studies of how inheritance of cellular traits can affect the evolution of group behaviors."

Sauro</p>\n\nThe BioModels Repository contains over 1000 manually curated mechanistic models from published literature, most often encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). This community-based standard formally specifies each model, but does not describe the computational experimental conditions to run a simulation and collect data. Therefore, it can be challenging to reproduce any figure or result from a publication with an SBML model alone. The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) provides a solution: a standard way to specify exactly how to run an experiment corresponding to a specific figure or result. BioModels was established years before SED-ML, and both systems evolved over time, both in content and acceptance. Hence, only about half of the entries in BioModels contained SED-ML files, and these files reflected the version of SED-ML that was available at the time. Additionally, almost all of these SED-ML files had at least one minor mistake that made them impossible to run. To make these models and their results more reproducible, we report here on our work updating, correcting and generating new SED-ML files for 1055 curated mechanistic models in BioModels. In addition, because SED-ML is implementation-independent, it can be used for <i>verification</i>, demonstrating that results hold across multiple simulation engines. We tested, corrected, and improved over 450 existing SED-ML files in the BioModels database, and created basic files for the rest of the entries. Then, we used a wrapper architecture for interpreting SED-ML, and report verification results across five different ODE-based biosimulation engines, after further improving the models, the wrappers, and the engines themselves. Our work with SED-ML and the BioModels collection aims to improve the utility of these models by making them more reproducible and credible. Improved reproducibility means these models are now even more fit for re-use, such as in new investigations and as components of multiscale models."

    "content": "<p>by Aditya Kamat, Asha Mary Joseph, Deeksha Rathour, Anjana Badrinarayanan</p>\n\nBacteria encode for gene regulatory networks crucial for sensing and repairing DNA damage. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, these transcriptional networks are induced in a temporally structured manner. A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response that is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA box properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. We observe that LexA box properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as one of the factors modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses."

    "content": "<p>by Yizhun Zeng, Xiaopeng Song, Qi Chen, Yue Gu, Jie Zhang, Tao Zhou, Zhihao Li, Tao Wang, Le Chang, Hongwei Yao, Yan Wang, Liyan Miao, Liujia Qian, Tiannan Guo, Yong Zhang, Sonia Rodriguez-Fernandez, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Ying Xu</p>\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, orchestrates daily metabolic rhythms, yet its role in substrate selection and thermogenic adaptation under stress remains insufficiently understood. Here, we show that SCN lesioning abolishes the adaptive suppression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis typically observed during time-restricted feeding in subthermoneutral environments (TRF-STE), a paradigm that imposes concurrent nutrient and thermal stress. Contrary to wild-type responses, SCN-lesioned mice maintain elevated BAT thermogenic activity, despite impaired lipolysis, instead shifting toward glucose-driven heat production. This phenotype is accompanied by sustained sympathetic tone and \u03b23-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) signaling in BAT. Mechanistically, we identify a SCN-regulated ADRB3-S100B signaling axis underlying this metabolic reprogramming. S100B, a nutrient-sensitive calcium-binding protein, is upregulated in BAT following SCN disruption, where it promotes thermogenesis by stimulating brown adipocyte proliferation and suppressing senescence. Functional studies reveal that S100B is both necessary and sufficient for sustaining BAT thermogenesis under TRF-STE. Furthermore, diverse SCN disruption models, including light-induced circadian arrhythmia, N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) excitotoxicity, and Caspase-3-mediated ablation, consistently elevate S100B expression in BAT, reinforcing its role as a convergent effector of SCN-regulated metabolic adaptation. Thus, in intact animal, the SCN restrains the ADRB3-S100B module, gating BAT thermogenic output in accordance with energetic availability. Disruption of SCN output lifts this restraint, unmasking a latent ADRB3-S100B program that preserves thermogenesis when lipid fuel is limited. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the SCN in governing thermogenic flexibility and fuel partitioning, and position the ADRB3-S100B axis as a potential target for mitigating circadian misalignment and metabolic disease."

Disruptions in these processes can contribute to various diseases, including cancer. The Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of tissue growth, plays a central role in cancer through its main effector, the Yes-associated protein (YAP), known as Yorkie (Yki) in <i>Drosophila</i>. In this model organism, <i>Yki</i> upregulation drives benign tissue overgrowth in imaginal discs. Our research demonstrates that the conserved metabolic regulator dPGC1 restricts Yki-driven tissue hyperplasia and helps maintain epithelial integrity in vivo. Combined <i>Yki</i> upregulation and <i>dPGC1</i> depletion results in tumors characterized by enlarged mitochondria and the upregulation of genes promoting mitochondrial fusion, a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for Yki-driven oncogenic growth. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial enlargement is associated with increased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin E, which plays a critical role in tumor development. These findings identify dPGC1 as a context-dependent tumor suppressor that coordinates mitochondrial dynamics and cell cycle regulation in response to oncogene activation, with implications for understanding cancer development in humans."

    "content": "The RNA-binding protein Ptbp1 has been proposed as a master regulator of neuronal fate, repressing neurogenesis through its effects on alternative splicing and miRNA maturation. While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following <i>Ptbp1</i> loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted <i>Ptbp1</i> in mouse retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and M\u00fcller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in <i>Ptbp1</i> mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of <i>Ptbp1</i> in mature glia. Our findings demonstrate that Ptbp1 is dispensable for retinal cell fate specification and suggest that its proposed role as a central repressor of neurogenesis should be reevaluated."

    "content": "The human fingertip can detect small tactile features with a spatial acuity roughly the width of a fingerprint ridge. However, how individual ridges deform under contact to support accurate and high-precision tactile feedback is currently unknown. The complex mechanical structure of the glabrous skin, composed of multiple layers and intricate morphology within which mechanoreceptors are embedded, makes this question challenging. Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image and track sub-surface deformations of hundreds of individual fingerprint ridges across ten participants and four individual contact events at high spatial resolution in vivo. We calculated strain patterns in both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis in response to a variety of passively applied tactile stimuli, including static indentation, stick-to-slip events, sliding of a flat surface in different directions, and interaction with small tactile features, such as edges and grooves. We found that ridges could stretch, compress, and undergo considerable shearing orthogonal to the skin surface, but there was limited horizontal shear. Therefore, it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves. We conclude that the local distribution of mechanoreceptors across the ridges might be ideally suited to extract the resulting strain gradients and that the fingertip skin may possess a higher mechanical spatial resolution than that of a single ridge."

    "content": "Stereotyped neural sequences are often exhibited in the brain, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Birdsong is a prominent model to study such behavior, particularly because juvenile songbirds progressively learn from their tutors and by adulthood are able to sing stereotyped song patterns. The songbird premotor nucleus HVC coordinates motor and auditory activity responsible for learned vocalizations. The HVC comprises three neural populations that have distinct in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological responses. Typically, models that explain HVC\u2019s network either rely on intrinsic HVC circuitry to propagate sequential activity, rely on extrinsic feedback to advance the sequence, or rely on both. Here, we developed a physiologically realistic neural network model incorporating the three classes of HVC neurons based on the ion channels and the synaptic currents that had been pharmacologically identified. Our model is based on a feedforward chain of microcircuits that encode for the different sub-syllabic segments (SSSs) and that interact with each other through structured feedback inhibition. The network reproduced the in vivo activity patterns of each class of HVC neurons and unveiled key intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that govern the sequential propagation of neural activity by highlighting important roles for the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current, A-type K<sup>+</sup> current, hyperpolarization-activated inward current, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The result is a biophysically realistic model that suggests an improved characterization of the HVC network responsible for song production in the songbird."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates beneath the Pamir Plateau has produced complex continental subduction, significantly influencing upper crustal faulting and seismicity. To investigate the kinematic behavior of the High Pamir Plateau, we derive a geodetic slip model for the 2023 Mw 6.9 Pamir earthquake by using Sentinel\u20101A and ALOS\u20102 InSAR data. Our geodetic inversion reveals rupture along two distinct faults: a dominant left\u2010lateral strike\u2010slip fault and a secondary normal fault, consistent with the mechanisms of the 1911 Mw 7.3 and 2015 Mw 7.2 earthquakes in the region. Notably, the 2015 and 2023 ruptures extend to \u223c20\u00a0km depth\u2014deeper than typical Tibetan Plateau earthquakes\u2014likely due to the thermal influence of the underlying cratonic lithosphere. Our results also indicate a broad shear zone above the underthrusting Indian plate, underscoring the role of lithospheric\u2010scale dynamics in shaping crustal fault behavior in the Pamir region."

Laboratory experiments demonstrated a strong linear relationship between hydraulic head difference (\u0394h) and seepage rate (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.996), consistent with Darcy's Law, and indicated that the device accurately measures seepage across a range of controlled conditions. Comparative testing against conventional collection\u2010bag methods showed close agreement, with no significant difference (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Field tests in a coastal lagoon yielded seepage rates on the order of 10\u22124\u00a0cm/s\u2014about five times higher than previously reported, yet consistent in order and gaining conditions\u2014demonstrating its potential as a promising alternative to existing seepage measurement methods."

    "content": "Abstract\nSubmerged vegetation canopies are widespread and influence bedload sediment transport in rivers, wetlands and deltas. However, the impacts of submerged canopies on sediment transport have not been fully quantified. This study used model Vallisneria denseserrulata to construct submerged flexible canopies in a mobile bed. Velocity, turbulence, and bedload transport were measured for a range of canopy submergence and density and compared with theoretical models predicting near\u2010bed turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and bedload transport. Within a submerged canopy, the near\u2010bed TKE includes not only bed\u2010 and stem\u2010generated TKE, but also TKE generated in the shear\u2010layer at the canopy top. The prediction of near\u2010bed TKE and transport rate within submerged canopies improved when the contribution from canopy\u2010shear layer\u2010generated TKE was included. The proposed model can accurately evaluate sediment transport and thus increase the prediction accuracy of vegetated landscapes, providing guidance for the maintenance and restoration of rivers, wetlands and deltas."

    "content": "Gene expression shapes phenotypes and evolution. However, studies of gene regulation focus on transcription factors, overlooking core promoters. To investigate how promoters emerge and regulate transcription, we determined the sequence-function landscapes of core elements, -35 and -10, in constitutive and transcription factor-regulated promoters in Escherichia coli. Characterization of in vivo transcriptional landscapes and in vitro RNA polymerase-promoter interactions showed the -10 element as essential for promoter evolution from random sequences. In contrast, the -35 element, though broadly conserved, is dispensable for promoter birth. Instead, it exerts greater impact on gene regulation via coordinated interactions with transcription activators and RNA polymerase. We further showed that evolution fine-tunes the -35 and -10 sequences of transcription factor-regulated promoters to achieve near-maximal fold changes by lowering basal while elevating induced expression. A notable exception is PluxI, whose leaky expression provides a crucial baseline for initiating quorum sensing. These findings elucidate promoter design principles and underscore the interdependence and coevolution of core elements, RNA polymerase, and transcription factors."

    "content": "Biomolecular neural networks (BNNs) offer a promising framework for implementing advanced computation in living cells, but their performance in vivo is fundamentally constrained by competition for cellular resources. In this work, we develop a mathematical and computational framework to analyze how shared translational resources (i.e., competition for ribosomes) affect protein neural networks implemented via molecular sequestration. Focusing on classification tasks, we show that ribosome competition primarily induces a rescaling of the neural network's effective weights, while preserving the shape of the decision boundary under identical mRNA-ribosome affinities. However, when these affinities are heterogeneous, limited resources lead to a bounded bending of the decision boundary, generating a well-defined uncertainty region. Importantly, classification remains reliable outside this region. Then, we extend our analysis from a perceptron to a multi-layer architectures (MLP), and illustrate that robustness to resource competition is maintained for an MLP with 2 nodes in the hidden layer. To our knowledge, this is the first protein-level neural-network circuit design shown to tolerate competition for translational resources without auxiliary insulation or feedback control."

    "content": "Cell-cell communication networks govern tissue function in health and disease, but existing computational tools rely on static ligand-receptor databases and correlation-based analyses that cannot distinguish direct causal relationships from confounding or indirect associations. We introduce Cell-CLIP (Cellular Causal Learning and Inference Pipeline), a modular framework applying Pearl's causal discovery algorithms to infer directed cell program interaction networks from patient-level single-cell RNA-seq data. Cell-CLIP aggregates noisy single-cell expression into biologically interpretable cell program activity scores, then applies PC (constraint-based) and GES (score-based) causal discovery algorithms to learn directed acyclic graphs representing putative causal relationships. We applied Cell-CLIP to a 176-patient lung atlas (normal, COVID-19, adenocarcinoma) focusing on 14 universal cell programs active across all phenotypes. Hybrid consensus causal discovery (PC and GES union) identified 21 directed edges, yielding a sparse network (11.5% density) dominated by macrophage program hubs. Four edges discovered by both algorithms (Intersection consensus) agree with known biological knowledge, included well-validated biological mechanisms like: CD8/NK differentiation cascades, macrophage sensing-recruitment etc. Quantitative benchmarking against a 40-edge Pearson correlation baseline demonstrated Cell-CLIP's complementary advantages: while correlation showed low specificity (28% of edges truly causal) and sensitivity (52% recall of causal edges), Cell-CLIP achieved 100% specificity by eliminating spurious associations from confounding and indirect paths. Key methodological advances include: correction for confounding by rejecting spurious correlations, detection of masked direct effects via conditional independence testing, inference of causal directionality distinguishing sequential regulatory cascades from co-regulation, and generation of novel predictions for experimental validation. Cell-CLIP provides a hypothesis-generating framework for discovering candidate causal circuits in cell-cell communication that extends beyond correlation-based methods, though inferred relationships require experimental validation due to observational data limitations."

While single-cell transcriptomics has established probabilistic frameworks for doublet detection, these methods are ill-suited for the sparser throughput of SCP datasets. This work presents scpImaging, a novel computational pipeline that repurposes the latent microscopy data routinely generated during cellenONE-based sample preparation to provide deterministic quality control (QC) and high-content phenotypic profiling. We demonstrate that standard proteomic quality metrics for SCP (e.g., peptide count, signal intensity) paradoxically favour retaining doublets. In contrast, scpImaging applies machine-learning-based cell segmentation (Cellpose-SAM) to identify and exclude these artefacts with high precision. Furthermore, the framework integrates morphological metrics generated using the open-source CellProfiler, with proteomic abundance data, enabling joint analysis that links cell shape and texture to molecular cell state. Provided as an open-source R package, scpImaging offers a scalable, automated solution for enhancing data integrity and adding a phenotypic dimension to SCP experiments without increasing experimental cost or complexity."

In this study, we present the application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to bioprocessing, introducing an ensemble-based framework for dual state and parameter estimation that enables mechanistic model adaptation across distinct systems. The EnKF recursively assimilates process measurements to update uncertain kinetic parameters and predict system states, allowing a model developed for one system to be transferred to a new one without reparametrisation and using only a single experimental dataset. The evolving parameter ensembles provide a time-resolved sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters have dominant influence under new process conditions and when their effects become significant. The framework was evaluated across six CHO cell experimental datasets differing in scale, cell line, temperature, and feeding strategy, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of system dynamics and progressive improvement in long-term predictions as new data became available. By maintaining full mechanistic transparency while flexibly adapting to new data, the EnKF offers a practical route for knowledge transfer across systems, strengthening the role of mechanistic modelling in data-informed bioprocess understanding and control."

Here, we develop SpaceCycle, a computational framework that infers the continuous cell-cycle phase and associated oscillatory gene expression dynamics from spatial transcriptomic data. Using human melanoma, breast, and lung tumors, we map both discrete and continuous cell-cycle states across entire tissue sections to reveal how proliferative activity is spatially structured within the TME. We find that cycling and non-cycling cells form distinct spatial niches reflecting differences in vascularization, immune composition, and cellular density. Continuous-phase inference further exposes tumor-specific variations in cell cycle phase durations and uncovers oscillatory programs. Together, our results provide a spatiotemporal view of cell-cycle organization in human tumors and establish a general framework for detecting dynamic transcriptional programs and spatial proliferation patterns from static tissue data."

A key layer of this regulation involves phosphorylation of Pol IIs C-terminal domain (CTD), a repetitive heptapeptide tail that coordinates transcription and RNA-processing factors. The kinase P-TEFb plays a major role in this process, yet its precise phosphorylation mechanism remains unclear. Previous in vitro studies have suggested a distributive mode of action based largely on qualitative inspection of mass spectrometry data rather than quantitative analysis. Here, we use mathematical modeling of CTD phosphorylation to explore whether local context, such as neighboring phosphorylations or directional biases, affects PTEFb activity on the CTD. Our results indicate that P-TEFb acts distributively but with pronounced local cooperativity: repeats adjacent to phosphorylated sites are modified at higher rates. We find no evidence for directional bias, although the limited positional resolution of the data precludes a definitive conclusion. These results identify local context as an important factor in P-TEFb-mediated CTD phosphorylation and establish a quantitative modeling framework for dissecting multi-site modification dynamics."

    "content": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) arises from coupled interactions between blood flow, tissue mechanics, and cellular signaling. Hemodynamic forces influence endothelial and interstitial cell behavior, while the resulting tissue remodeling alters valve motion and flow patterns. Capturing this two-way feedback requires models that integrate fluid-structure mechanics with biochemical regulation, yet such multiscale coupling remains technically challenging. Previous computational models have focused on isolated aspects of the disease: fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations reproduce valve deformation and flow, and systems biology (SB) models describe molecular signaling that drives fibrosis and calcification. However, without coupling, these approaches cannot predict how mechanical dysfunction initiates biochemical remodeling or how biochemical changes feed back on mechanics. Here, we present a multi-physics computational framework that couples three-dimensional FSI simulations of aortic valve dynamics with a mechanistic SB model of calcification signaling. The FSI module resolves pulsatile blood flow and leaflet deformation, yielding local wall shear stresses and tissue strains throughout the cardiac cycle. These mechanical quantities are used as inputs to the SB module, which represents key biochemical pathways governing inflammation, TGF-{beta}/SMAD signaling, and nitric-oxide (NO)--mediated inhibition within valvular cells. Simulations predict long-term calcification trajectories for valves of varying thickness, showing that fibrosis-induced stiffening lowers shear stress, reduces NO synthesis, and enhances TGF-{beta} activation, thereby accelerating calcification. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing future incorporation of additional pathways, as well as implementation of full two-way coupling between the FSI and SB models. By integrating physics-based hemodynamics with systems-level biochemistry, this study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a next-generation, multi-scale modeling platform for studying cardiovascular disease that unites blood flow dynamics and biochemical signaling."

    "content": "The lac operon in Escherichia coli has been used as a model of gene regulation throughout biology since its characterization in the early 1960s. Despite the myriad of biotechnology applications that arose from characterization of the lac system, the explanation for the importance of a functional lac operon in normal bladder colonization by uropathogenic E. coli remains unknown given that the prototypical substrate, lactose, is not normally known to be readily available within the urinary tract. Here, we identified a unique uropathogenic clinical isolate (5.3r) that has a two codon deletion in the LacY permease, leading to impaired {beta}-galactoside metabolism and attenuation of development of critical intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in which UPEC replicates to high numbers, and then disseminates during urinary tract infection. Further, we show that expression of a functional lacY permease gene is sufficient to rescue defects in IBC size and number in 5.3r. In addition, we demonstrate that UPEC are able to utilize the disaccharide galactose {beta}-1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (LacNAc) -- which appears as the terminal glycan in a subset of the glycoproteins that decorate the apical surface of bladder epithelial cells -- as a sole carbon source in a lac system dependent manner. These data suggest that the lac operon is important to the growth and development of intracellular E. coli through metabolism of host bladder cell glycans."

The responses of Foz to these compounds exhibited notable variations, which may be attributed to the structural differences among the autotoxins. The autotoxic compounds differentially enhanced the key pathogenic traits of Foz. Syringic acid was the most effective stimulant of mycelial growth and cell wall-degrading enzymes activity, concurrently boosting mycotoxin production via upregulating FUB3 gene expression. Ferulic acid was the most potent promoter of sporulation and biomass accumulation, whereas 7-Hydroxycoumarin most effectively stimulated conidial germination. Notably, coumarin suppressed mycelial growth but strongly induced mycotoxin synthesis in Foz. These results provide mechanistic insights into how autotoxins in ginger monoculture systems promote Fusarium wilt."

    "content": "Treatment failure rates for fungal infections cannot be explained simply by increased rates of drug resistance. Antifungal drug tolerance, the ability of a susceptible isolate to grow in the presence of inhibitory drug concentrations, relies upon a broad set of stress response pathways and can contribute to antifungal drug treatment failures. As the physical properties of the cytoplasm are critical for diverse cellular processes, we investigated whether cytoplasmic mesoscale fluidity is linked to antifungal tolerance, taking advantage of a fluorescent microrheological probe. Here, we show either using fluconazole, a common drug that inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, or mutants in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, that cytoplasmic fluidity decreased and could be reversed upon drug removal. Reducing ribosome concentration decreased drug tolerance and restored cytoplasmic fluidity, highlighting a link between tolerance and cytoplasmic crowding and/or viscosity. However, growth in fluconazole did not increase ribosome concentrations; rather growth in fluconazole increased the number of dormant, hibernating ribosomes, cytoplasmic protein concentration, viscosity and condensate formation. Specifically, growth in fluconazole resulted in a substantial increase in processing bodies (P-bodies), whose presence correlated with azole tolerance. Furthermore, we found a substantial increase in cell-cell heterogeneity in all biophysical, biochemical and molecular outputs analyzed. Together, our results reveal that changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm occur in response to antifungal drug and suggest that these changes, as well as increased cell-cell heterogeneity, are crucial for survival in fungistatic drugs."

    "content": "Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, and treatment options are increasingly compromised by the global rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Furthermore, the absence of effective vaccines against many causative agents renders large populations vulnerable. This critical gap necessitates the development of novel alternatives that can function both prophylactically to prevent infection and therapeutically to treat established diseases. Here, we investigated the commensal Escherichia coli strain HK220822 (HK5), which was isolated from a healthy human, as a potential live biotherapeutic. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic characterization established a robust safety profile, confirming the absence of key virulence genes while demonstrating essential probiotic traits, including high tolerance to gastrointestinal stressors, such as acid and bile. The functional efficacy of Escherichia coli HK5 has been validated in murine models of infection. Prophylactic administration before pathogen exposure significantly inhibited intestinal colonization by Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri 2a, and Vibrio cholerae (El Tor O1 strain). Moreover, HK5 demonstrated therapeutic potential by significantly reducing pathogen shedding when administered to previously infected animals. These findings establish commensal E. coli (HK5) as a potent candidate with dual preventative and therapeutic efficacy, offering a promising non-antibiotic strategy to combat diarrheal diseases."

Previous RNA sequencing analysis revealed a high level of antisense transcription in Ot, particularly from RAGE-encoded genes, with 18% of all genes having a sense:antisense ratio <1 and 5% with a ratio <0.1. In our current study, we have confirmed the earlier RNA sequencing findings via PCR-based methods and established that this antisense transcription is a consistent feature across eight distinct Ot strains. Furthermore, we have utilized PCR to monitor differences in sense and antisense expression between intracellular and extracellular bacteria.

Here, we employed a robust integration of bulk and bacterial single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to uncover how individual cells of Acinetobacter baumannii reorganise the heterogenous transcriptome in response to antibiotic. Using polymyxin as a representative, bulk RNA-seq showed canonical envelope- and efflux-centred responses but obscured underlying heterogeneity. Single-cell profiling resolved these averages into discrete subpopulations whose abundances shifted with concentration and time. Specifically, in early time an envelope-stress programme predominated survival at the low concentration, whereas an outer-membrane repair/efflux programme dominated survival at the high concentration. These patterns revealed structured and time-resolved heterogeneity, highlighting an ingenious bacterial stress responsive strategy. Through trajectory inference, we further revealed a concentration-dependent bifurcation of cell fates: low-concentration treated cells detoured through a transient stress state and rejoined growth, whereas high-concentration treated survivors diverted into a slow-growing, tolerant branch. Perturbing marker genes from these programmes altered fitness eventually and rapidly increased permeability, depolarisation and reactive-oxygen burden, linking state to survival capability. Collectively, we map a dynamic, concentration-structured landscape of antibiotic responses at the single-cell level, revealing diverse survival trajectories that are obscured in conventional population-averaged analyses. Our developed single-cell based framework revealed tolerant bacterial cells with rewiring of the transcriptional landscape, causing emergence of antibiotic resistance. Importantly, these findings urge precision antimicrobial therapy in patients to minimise emergence of antibiotic resistance."

The N-amendments altered soil properties, adversely impacting microbial abundance, diversity, and community composition. The 16S rRNA gene qPCR and amplicon sequencing indicated a negative effect of N on bacterial and archaeal abundance, species diversity, and richness. Our analyses revealed the predominance and cosmopolitan distribution of Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidota, their extensive adaptability and metabolic versatility under different N-amended conditions. Soil microbial community exhibited distinct responses to added N-substrates, with some bacterial taxa (Sphingomonadales) showing enhanced abundances while others were inhibited (Thermodesulfovibrionia and Clostridiales). The core-community across N-amended sets exhibited 68% taxonomic variation from its native counterpart, with two most abundant members of native soil, Nitrosomonadaceae and Beijerinckiaceae, diminishing, while Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae became more prominent and resilient under N-amended conditions. The co-occurrence network highlighted that though total and core soil communities responded to N-amendments with an increased abundance of copiotroph bacteria, oligotrophs thrived under nutrient-limited conditions, serving as keystone taxa during prolonged fertilisation.

Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the EEHV1A gH/gL/gO complex at 3.2[A] resolution, revealing a conserved overall architecture but distinct gO topology and disulfide arrangement. The EEHV1A trimer, but not gH/gL alone, bound primary elephant endothelial cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes, indicating that gH/gL/gO serves as the receptor-binding complex of EEHV1A. This binding was specifically blocked by sera from naturally infected elephants, confirming its antigenic relevance. Finally, negative-stain electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping of gH/gL/gO-Fab complexes identified a Fab population that bound gO near the apex of the gH/gL/gO trimer, suggesting that these antibodies may interfere with gH/gL/gO-receptor interactions. Together, these findings define the molecular architecture and receptor-binding properties of the EEHV1A gH/gL/gO complex and provide a structural framework for the development of vaccines and antibody-based interventions against EEHV-associated disease."

Each of the currently available 3 antifungal drug classes is limited by toxicities, drug interactions or inadequate penetration of critical tissues. We discovered a connection between C. albicans TOR and thioredoxin reductase, Trr1. Fungal and human thioredoxin reductases diverge fundamentally and are essential for repair of oxidatively damaged macromolecules, so they may be promising drug targets. We found that Trr1 is required for growth of C. albicans at human body temperatures, hyphal growth regulation and management of oxidative and cell wall stress. Its depletion sensitizes C. albicans to AmphotericinB and to an echinocandin. TRR1-depleted cells have lower cell wall glucan content. Metabolomics experiments highlighted their perturbed pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). They have sharply elevated activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the first, rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. A key glycolytic, gluconeogenic and UDP-glucose biosynthetic enzyme each show decreased activity. UDP-glucose is the substrate of cell wall glucan-producing enzymes. We propose that accelerated glucose-6-phosphate flux into the PPP in TRR1-depleted cells, driven by demand for NADPH reducing equivalents, diminishes glucose-6-phosphate availability for UDP-glucose production and hence for cell wall construction, weakening the wall. Strikingly dysregulated signaling pathways in Trr1-depleted cells contribute to their stress hypersensitivities."

The mosquito-specific artivirus Omono River virus (OmRV) also expresses this CrP, which has been suggested to facilitate viral infection and propagation, although it may not be essential. To clarify its role in viral infection, we generated a CrP deletion mutant of OmRV to directly assess its functional significance. The absence of CrP does not affect infectivity in mosquito cells or alter the capsid structure. However, CPE and viral propagation are still affected.

All isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), with a majority exhibiting resistance to meropenem, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and gentamicin. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis indicated that these isolates were belonged to 12 distinct sequence types (STs), with the most prevalent STs being ST10 and ST5299. Additionally, Phylogenomic analysis revealed that clonal spread of blaNDM-positive ST10 E. coli isolates at swine wastewater in multiple cities, including Binzhou, Dezhou, Heze and Weihai. Meanwhile, a notable divergence in SNPs was observed in isolates from this study and public database, which indicates that these blaNDM-positive E. coli isolates have high genetic diversity. In addition, WGS analysis further revealed that blaNDM co-existed with other antibiotic resistance genes, conferring resistance to twelve classes of antimicrobials. This study underscores the importance of surveillance for blaNDM-harboring microbes in swine wastewater, and continuous monitoring in swine wastewater is essential for ensure human and environmental health."

    "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a critical threat to global health, largely driven by the dissemination of {beta}-lactamases that inactivate frontline antibiotics. Among the most problematic are BlaMab-2 from Mycobacterium abscessus, KPC-2 and OXA-48 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and VIM-2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which together confer broad resistance to {beta}-lactams and carbapenems. Current {beta}-lactamase inhibitors face declining efficacy as resistance variants continue to emerge, underscoring the need for innovative strategies. Here, we explored single-domain antibodies (sd-Abs) as enzyme-directed inhibitors of {beta}-lactamases. A library of sd-Abs was screened, and two candidates, B2 and B5, were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Both sd-Abs inhibited BlaMab-2 activity in E. coli expression systems, following a competitive inhibition mechanism, with B2 consistently displaying stronger potency (Ki {approx} 1.5 M) than B5. Remarkably, B2 also demonstrated broad inhibitory activity against KPC-2, VIM-2, and OXA-48, while B5 showed an alternative inhibition profile, including uncompetitive characteristics against VIM-2 and OXA-48. Comparison with clinically deployed inhibitors revealed that the Ki values of B2 and B5 are of the same order of magnitude, or superior in some cases, highlighting their therapeutic promise. Our findings establish sd-Abs as a versatile platform for the inhibition of diverse {beta}-lactamases, with B2 emerging as the most broadly effective candidate. By expanding the utility of existing {beta}-lactams, sd-Abs could help restore antibiotic efficacy against multidrug-resistant pathogens. This study underscores the potential of antibody-based enzyme inhibitors as a new class of anti-resistance therapeutics."

    "content": "Diatom blooms influence carbon cycling through organic matter production and its subsequent deposition or remineralization - processes that are all tightly mediated by interactions with the microbial community. Viruses, as integral part of microbial communities, are known to influence diatom bloom dynamics and can even terminate blooms. However, the three-way interactions between diatoms, their viruses and associated bacteria remain poorly resolved. In this study we examined how infection of the toxigenic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia galaxiae by its ssRNA virus PnGalRNAV reshapes host physiology, microbiome structure and organic-matter processing in non-axenic batch cultures. With an integrated transcriptomics and microscopy-based approach, we investigated the response of the bacterial community to dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by viral lysis of diatoms and observed a significant increase of Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteriodetes) suggesting a specialized role in utilizing DOM released due to viral lysis. Despite overwhelming viral RNA, bacterial metatranscriptomes revealed upregulation of polysaccharide-degradation associated genes, indicating active utilisation of virus-derived diatom glycans. Host transcripts showed broad repression of photosynthesis, silicon metabolism and core biosynthetic pathways, alongside induction of heat-shock and other stress-related genes, consistent with a senescence-like state. Our results demonstrate that PnGalRNAV infection speeds the termination of P. galaxiae growth, rapidly converting a productive diatom culture into a detrital DOM-rich environment that selects for specialised polysaccharide degraders and redirects carbon through the viral shunt. Infected cultures reached senescence much sooner than uninfected ones, suggesting that the ssRNA virus of Pseudo-nitzschia galaxiae can shorten bloom duration and accelerate nutrient recycling, with implications for coastal biogeochemistry. By integrating spatially resolved microscopy with community and metatranscriptomic profiling, this study links microbial composition, localization, and functional activity during diatom viral lysis. Our comprehensive approach can be extended to diverse diatom-virus systems in the future to better predict when viral outbreaks will favour recycling versus export of phytoplankton-derived carbon."

While phage satellites are widespread in diverse bacterial hosts, none have been isolated in Mycobacteriaceae. Here, we report the first phage satellites isolated and characterized in Mycobacteriaceae, Extracellular Prophage-Inducing Particles (EPIPs). EPIPs induce a helper phage--HerbertWM, a Mycolicibacterium aichiense prophage--upon infection. Genomic sequencing of thirteen isolates revealed a notably small genome size and high sequence similarity between EPIPs, suggesting they are a distinct class of phage satellite. EPIPs were categorized into groups based on Virus Intergenomic Distance Calculator similarity scores, gene content, and synteny. Gene content is largely conserved across the isolates, though EPIPs notably lack capsid proteins, tail proteins, and holins, suggesting EPIPs hijack the machinery of HerbertWM to replicate, assemble, and lyse the host. Furthermore, the unique gene content of EPIPs compared to other phage satellites, particularly the presence of a tape measure protein and absence of antirepressors, suggests they may exhibit unique mechanisms of assembly and prophage induction. Transmission electron microscopy of EPIPs reveals that they not only feature smaller capsids compared to HerbertWM, but that they feature longer tails of variable length, further suggesting a unique mechanism of tail hijacking that the tape measure protein may facilitate. Additionally, greater EPIP protein similarity to prophage proteins as opposed to free phage proteins suggests a functional or evolutionary relationship may exist. The synteny among EPIPs and the unique gene content suggest EPIPs are a distinct class of phage satellites that induce Mycobacteriaceae prophages."

    "content": "Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are widespread in nature and contribute to global carbon and nitrogen cycling. Although their energy production is an aerobic process, AOA occur in environments of low oxygen and in fully anoxic zones. Recently, oxygen production under anoxic conditions was demonstrated, raising the hypothesis that this activity can sustain oxygen dependent ammonia oxidation. In the work presented here, Nitrososphaera viennensis produces high amounts of oxygen in anoxia in dependence of nitrite but not ammonia. Rather than conferring a physiological benefit, oxygen production impaired recovery from anoxia. Produced oxygen is mostly not consumed and therefore cannot sustain ammonia oxidation in the absence of external oxygen. Instead, it is tightly linked to the amount of available redox equivalents. These observations indicate that oxygen production represents a general physiological strategy for alleviating the potential accumulation of reactive intermediates in the ammonia oxidation pathway, analogous to nitrifier denitrification in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria."

Here, we demonstrate that phages harbored by environmental bacteria can be exploited for programmable synthesis of functional eDNA superstructures. We designed a 112-nucleotide circular template (T1) and used it to direct rolling circle replication (RCR) of G-quadruplex (GQ) motifs in Shewanella oneidensis and Bacillus subtilis. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, prophage activation triggered cell lysis and subsequent extracellular DNA synthesis, producing multimeric GQ concatemers that self-assembled into distinct morphologies: spherical structures ([&le;]10 m) in S. oneidensis and wire-like structures (>50 m) in B. subtilis. Real-time monitoring using fluorescent reporter strains revealed that DNA synthesis occurred predominantly after bacterial lysis, coinciding with prophage replication. The resulting DNA superstructures exhibited peroxidase activity through GQ-hemin DNAzyme formation and enhanced the electrochemical properties of S. oneidensis biofilms, showing a 3-fold increase in current density. This work unveils a previously unknown mechanism by which prophages contribute to biofilm architecture and establishes a biotechnological platform for engineering functional DNA materials in living bacterial communities, with potential applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology."

The development and testing relied on 1,077 Gram stain images of varying sizes, originating from different laboratories and captured using diverse microscopes at different points in time, resulting in differences in image quality, scaling, color balance, and the presence of artifacts. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing subsets, with the split performed in a stratified manner so that each object group was proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. Preprocessing involved computer vision techniques to improve contrast and color balance, detect contours and object borders, and implement filtering mechanisms to remove unwanted artifacts. Morphological analysis of shapes was then performed to extract parameters characterizing each contour. Next, human-like classification criteria--based on gradient, morphological features (e.g., shape, size) and spatial arrangement that mimic microbiologists visual assessment--were established, achieving around 92% accuracy in image classification without using machine learning (ML) methods. However, any further improvements turned practically impossible, prompting the use of ML methods. Thus, building on pre-obtained features, a random forest ML algorithm was employed to further refine the criteria, with three models trained and tested successively. Overall, the ML solution was significantly more accurate, reaching 99.9% accuracy in classifying the images into one of the aforementioned groups."

These domains were recently found to produce immune signaling molecules in plant immunity as well as in a family of bacterial defense systems called Thoeris. Here, we systematically scanned bacterial defense islands to identify anti-phage defense systems involving TIR-mediated signaling. We detected numerous configurations of such systems in bacterial genomes, involving ~30 different protein effectors predicted to respond to TIR-produced immune signals. We experimentally verified 15 new TIR-containing systems, showing that they provide defense against phages through effector protein domains not previously known as associated with immunity. Further biochemical analyses revealed bacterial Thoeris systems that generate 2'cADPR, an immune signaling molecule central to plant immunity. We also discover multiple types of Thoeris that drive antiphage defense via canonical cADPR, a signaling molecule known to mediate human innate immunity. Our studies show that TIR-based immune signaling systems exist in at least 8% of bacterial genomes, and suggest conservation of TIR-derived immune signals across the tree of life."

The microbial factors that can subvert this defence reaction remain poorly understood. While many microbes have been found to increase host intestinal peristalsis, Pseudomonas entomophila infection in Drosophila melanogaster leads to infection-induced defecation blockage, particularly in females. Here, we show that this phenotype is driven by a secreted, thermosensitive protein regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Proteomic comparison of the {Delta}gacA mutant, which does not inhibit defecation, and the avirulent {Delta}hfq mutant lacking RNA chaperon Hfq, which still triggers the phenotype, identified pore-forming toxin Monalysin as one of the candidate factors required for inhibiting defecation. Consistently, the Monalysin-deficient mutant was unable to inhibit defecation. Hence, Monalysin besides causing intestinal damage, has a previously unknown role in suppressing defecation and potentially pathogen expulsion. Overall, our study identified a bacterial factor that rapidly reduces defecation frequency, consistent with transient suppression of intestinal transit, thus advancing our understanding of pathogen strategies used to subvert host defences."

    "content": "In many low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, the global regulator Spx helps maintain thiol homeostasis during disulfide stress, when protein thiols form aberrant disulfide bonds that can lead to misfolding and oxidative damage. Spx-dependent gene expression is triggered when an intramolecular disulfide bond forms between two cysteines in its redox switch. Surprisingly, some Spx functions persist even in the absence of an active redox switch, highlighting the need to better understand the physiological significance of maintaining this regulatory feature. Here, we utilize a spxC10A mutant that encodes a redox-insensitive Spx variant to study the role of the Spx redox switch in Staphylococcus aureus. We show that the spxC10A mutant is hypersensitive to diamide-induced disulfide stress and exhibits widespread transcriptional dysregulation of genes that contribute to thiol maintenance and disulfide repair. Remarkably, the spxC10A mutant rapidly adapts to disulfide stress by increasing its intracellular pool of L-cysteine (L-Cys) through enhanced uptake, which helps restore a reduced intracellular environment. However, during this process increased L-Cys inadvertently depletes cytosolic Fe(II), leading to growth inhibition of the spxC10A mutant. Finally, we show that the Spx-dependent control of intracellular L-Cys is critical for S. aureus survival when it encounters human neutrophils. Overall, these findings suggest that staphylococcal adaptation to disulfide stress through intracellular L-Cys accumulation imposes significant fitness costs that S. aureus overcomes by rapid regulatory control of thiol homeostasis through a functional Spx redox switch."

    "content": "Orthoflaviviruses are medically important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause a significant global disease burden. Some of these viruses can cause neurological infections, requiring a clear understanding of how they enter the central nervous system (CNS). The choroid plexus (ChP) is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-producing tissue residing in the brain ventricles. The ChP forms a blood-CSF barrier, which acts as a crucial peripheral-CNS interface and a physical defense against neuroinvasive pathogens. While this tissue is increasingly recognized as a potential entry site for hematogenous pathogens, how orthoflaviviruses overcome the blood-CSF barrier and the corresponding intrinsic immune response in a human model remains critically undefined. This study aimed to investigate the potential of the ChP to serve as a neuroinvasive site for orthoflaviviruses. ChP organoids (ChPOs) derived from human inducible pluripotent stem cells were established and determined for susceptibility to a panel of orthoflaviviruses, namely Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Dengue virus (DENV). These viruses exhibited differential susceptibility to ChPOs, with the pathogenic JEV strain being the most infective. Transcriptomic analysis of ChPOs confirmed a robust interferon (IFN) response to JEV infection. Functional studies further demonstrated that antiviral defenses are crucial for controlling virus infection, and that type I IFN responses are superior to the epithelial-restricted type III IFN responses. Critically, despite the productive release of JEV into the CSF-like fluid within the ChP lumen, selective barrier integrity was maintained, confirming a nondestructive transcellular neuroinvasion mechanism across the blood-CSF barrier. This study highlights a valuable in vitro platform and its potential for studying virus neuroinvasion at the blood-CSF barrier."

    "content": "Warming temperatures are accelerating permafrost thaw and changing tundra vegetation, where woody shrubs are displacing sedges. Shrubs, such as Betula nana, and sedges, such as Eriophorum vaginatum, exhibit distinct life strategies including unique root-associated, or rhizosphere microbial communities. As permafrost thaws it unlocks previously unavailable carbon and nutrient sources resulting in deeper roots and a translocation of rhizosphere communities. Because permafrost microbial communities contain lower diversity and biomass than rhizosphere communities, the coalescence of rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities could alter soil organic matter (SOM) degradation rates and increase greenhouse gas emissions. To identify metabolic strategies across distinct rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities we conducted an isotope tracing incubation experiment. We inoculated thawed permafrost with shrub and sedge rhizosphere communities while adding exudates or water daily and compared this to an uninoculated control. After 46 days, we spiked samples with 18O enriched water or 13C enriched exudates and measured isotope incorporation into microbial DNA with quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). Our results indicate that exudate additions had little effect on uninoculated permafrost communities but the addition of exudates and rhizosphere inoculants had a compounding effect on respiration rates. We found that soils inoculated with shrub rhizosphere communities contained a mixture of exudate and SOM degraders while soils inoculated with sedge rhizosphere communities contained mainly SOM degraders. Finally, we found that individual microbial taxa exhibited maximum growth rates in one environment, which was a combination of microbial inoculant communities and exudate addition treatments. Our results reveal that microbial niches are strongly influenced by substrate preferences and community context, and suggest that a reduction in sedges and an expansion of shrubs may provide a mechanism by which permafrost carbon losses are mitigated through corresponding shifts in microbial communities and their substrate preferences."

Here we study the legume-rhizobium mutualism after 33 years of nitrogen fertilization. Pairing manipulative inoculation studies with long-read amplicon sequencing provides unprecedented resolution across biological scales: whole bacterial community, genus Rhizobium, individual Rhizobium ASVs, and symbiosis plasmids. Clover host plants in N-fertilized plots encounter microbial communities depauperate in their preferred symbiont but enriched in other Rhizobium taxa; moreover, their symbiotic nodules house low-quality symbiosis plasmids. Thus, concurrent ecological and evolutionary shifts make mutualists both rarer and inferior and feed back to decrease the benefits hosts receive from mutualism."

The field sites with mineral soils, which had a higher pH, had a higher bacterial and fungal diversity than organic soils. The organically managed fields had a higher bacterial diversity than the conventionally managed fields. Community structure of both bacteria and fungi was largely driven by field site including its main chemical characteristics, with rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from the same site displaying comparable assemblages. Higher soil microbial diversity was associated with higher postharvest storability in the stored carrots.

This also applies to virulent microorganisms, such as the major human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, whose pathogenic potential and epidemic proliferation largely depends on the interaction with environmental phages. Specifically, integration of the CTXphi; phage genome into the first chromosome of V. cholerae also introduced the ctxAB genes, encoding the primary toxin responsible for the severe acute diarrheal disease, cholera. Whereas the mechanisms underlying CTXphi-associated horizontal gene transfer and transcriptional control of the ctxAB genes have been intensively studied over the past years, post-transcriptional regulation affecting the CTXphi life-cycle has not been documented. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the CisR small RNA (sRNA) that is produced from the 3UTR (untranslated region) of the prtV gene and inhibits the expression of the CTXphi-encoded cep mRNA. CisR-mediated repression of cep involves Hfq-assisted base-pairing of the two transcripts and results in reduced CTXphi production under stress conditions. We further demonstrate that transcription of prtV-cisR requires both the master quorum-sensing regulator HapR and CRP, a global regulator of carbon metabolism. Taken together, our work provides evidence that V. cholerae employs sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation to coordinate CTXphi activation with both cell density and nutrient availability."

Conserved LP-rings act as slide-rotary bushings that permit high-speed rotation within a dynamic envelope yet can constrict to seal the pore upon stress-induced ejection. We further show that stator activation requires a specific PomB-MotX interaction rather than peptidoglycan engagement. Together, these findings reveal how the distinctive architecture and dynamics of the sheathed flagellum promote V. cholerae motility, environmental survival, and persistent colonization of the human gut."

Although significant progress has been made over the past decade in understanding the metabolic functions of clinically relevant Bacteroidota, far less is known about the environmental species. Despite being one of the dominant phyla linked to crops, there is limited information on the mechanisms that enable Bacteroidota to thrive in plant and soil environments. A key obstacle in understanding gene fitness in Bacteroidota is the lack of genome-wide functional studies, largely due to their inherent resistance to antibiotics, which complicates genetic manipulation. In this study, we used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to measure gene fitness in a plant-associated Bacteroidota, Mucilaginibacter yixingensis YX-36. Our data sheds light on pathways involved in rhizosphere colonization, gliding motility, stress tolerance, and carbon metabolism. Notably, we found that phylum-specific genes such as Polysaccharide Utilization Loci (PULs) and Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) are needed for fitness in the plant niche. Overall, this work advances our understanding of gene functions in environmental Bacteroidota species and provides a foundation for future research on their roles in plant-microbe interactions."

Here, we explored the microbial and glycobiological connectivity between the sea surface microlayer (SML), the underlying seawater (ULW), snow, and aerosol particles in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, 79N) during autumn and spring. The marked overlap between marine and atmospheric microbiomes illustrates considerable sea-air transfer, linked to seasonally distinct environmental communities. For instance, Polaribacter and Formosa were aerosolized during the spring bloom, compared to Colwellia in autumn. Air-mass trajectories and microbial source tracking revealed a greater marine contribution in autumn, whereas spring aerosols were shaped by stronger winds and the cryosphere. Aerosol particles nonetheless contained numerous unique taxa, including Actinobacteria likely originating from terrestrial sources. Linking bacterial, microeukaryotic, carbohydrate, and meteorological dynamics established an overarching perspective across seasons and habitats, identifying four distinct ecosystem states. Genome-sequenced bacterial model isolates, representing key environmental populations, encode adaptive traits such as carotenoid and ectoine biosynthesis, supporting survival in the SML and atmospheric transfer.

All accessions benefited from Si, indicating that endophyte-mediated disease mitigation occurs broadly across diverse host genotypes. A focused comparison of two genetically and geographically proximate Swedish accessions, T510 and T530, which displayed the most divergent protection scores, revealed substantial differences in Bs susceptibility. Transcriptome profiling under bi- and tripartite colonization showed conserved defense responses in both accessions. Bs infection downregulated growth- and development-related genes, consistent with a growth-immunity trade-off, with T530 exhibiting higher Bs colonization and a stronger transcriptional response than T510. Co-colonization with Si effectively suppressed pathogen growth and disease symptoms in both accessions. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses identified four immune receptor genes, including the TIR-NLR ISI, present in T510 but absent in T530. An isi T-DNA insertion mutant phenocopied the heightened Bs susceptibility of T530, confirming that ISI contributes to root immunity, while Si-mediated protection remained intact despite increased pathogen susceptibility. Together, these findings demonstrate that fungal endophytes can mitigate the functional consequences of natural immune variation and enhance the resilience of genetically diverse plant populations."

    "content": "Reef-building corals are sessile marine organisms that inhabit a wide range of light habitats along depth gradients. As coral biology is often studied in the context of global change and changing temperatures, knowledge gaps persist in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the responses to other factors than temperature, such as light intensity, which decreases exponentially in the water column and gradually changes the environment. To fill this gap, we tested the response of the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata to decreased light intensity in a field experiment in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, using Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) proteomics. There was a significant effect of light intensity on both the coral and zooxanthellae proteomes. In the M. capitata host, 69 proteins differed significantly in abundance between light levels after two years. The 50 proteins identified as significantly more abundant in the control condition were mostly involved in mRNA and RNA processing, pointing toward a positive correlation between metabolic activity, growth rates and increased light levels. The 19 proteins identified as significantly more abundant in the shade treatment were associated with calcium transport and with the structure of key cellular components, such as cell membrane and cytoskeleton. By contrast, zooxanthellae showed only minor changes in protein abundances, with photosynthesis proteins more abundant in the shade treatment and enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism more abundant in the control treatment. Overall, these findings establish a baseline for our understanding of the cellular and metabolic processes driving Montipora capitata's acclimatization potential to different light intensities."

Its constraint-based approach contrasts with function-based models widely applied in ecology. Total gross production ({Sigma}GP) by `wild components' (= species/life stages, grouped by ecological roles) is maximized within constraints over short time steps using linear programming, thereby enabling simulations of opportunistic growth and harvesting by competing components. Constraints use integrated terms from an n-component generalization of the Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model, and from mass-based models for fisheries, non-living organics, nutrients and essential habitats. Seasonality uses programmed temperature and light indices. Trial simulations, total 12, sought first to confirm conformance with LV theory. Further trials of gradually increasing ecosystem complexity were designed to simulate well-known ecological events. They found biomass oscillations depending on starting biomasses and seasons, predator satiation, competitive exclusion, predator diets dependent on available prey, instability of unconstrained 3-level food chains, limitation of GP by essential habitats and nutrients, recycling of nutrient and biomass, trophic cascades and wasp-waist systems caused by fishing, and seasonal succession. Step-wise studies of simulated series explained results. A `constrained-GP' hypothesis is proposed. Priorities for further developments are suggested. ECOLPS simulations could support cause-and-effect investigations, field work, and aquatic ecological risk assessments."

Despite being widely altered by global change, studies commonly overlook the interaction of seasonal characteristics and bidirectional migration on species coexistence and biomass production across meta-ecosystems. We developed a mathematical model to study how migration interacts with key characteristics of seasonality, amplitude of variation and length of summer, to influence migrant persistence, consumer coexistence, and biomass production. Our findings demonstrate that seasonal characteristics mediate the effect of migration on coexistence and biomass production across meta-ecosystems. However, the effects strongly depend on migration timing: phenological mismatches can reduce biomass at local and meta-ecosystem scales and lead to the extinction of migratory and non-migratory consumers. Our study highlights how migration and seasonality interact to shape community structure and ecosystem function across scales, emphasizing the importance of system-level approaches for studying ecological outcomes of global change."

Yet, our capability to map pollination service delivery in real-time across large areas remains poor. Determining where and when flowers are pollinated is vital to mitigate widespread pollination deficits, increase plant health and yield, and support pollinator management. Hence, innovative approaches are urgently needed for establishing scalable predictive bioindicators of plant pollination status with the goal of achieving real-time landscape-scale monitoring. Here we present two parallel controlled pollination assays in which we characterise the post-pollination petal physiology of a world leading flowering crop, Brassica napus, using in-situ close-range hyperspectral reflectance and semi-untargeted metabolomics. This multiomics approach coupled with supervised machine learning and biomarker detection reveals cryptic changes in the UV petal reflectance spectrum which are predictive of pollination status, representing a novel set of candidate pollination bioindicators (polli-markers), and our high-resolution time series enables prediction of when this pollination event occurred. It also reveals an associated set of candidate metabolites, including flavonoids and senescence markers, shedding light on the functional pathways related to our polli-markers. This study provides key insights into floral development, enabling a transformative step towards predicting, mapping and quantifying pollination service delivery at the landscape scale."

    "content": "Massive corals, like some Porites species, are key reef-builders and provide critical habitat on coral reefs. Porites often exhibit high tolerance to stressors, like warming from climate change, although the drivers of these patterns are unclear. Using high-throughput sequencing, we examined whether associations with Symbiodiniaceae underpin this tolerance. Symbiodiniaceae diversity and community composition within two massive species (Porites lutea and P. lobata), whose identities were verified through morphometric examinations, were examined across 200 km of Ningaloo World Heritage Reef, Australia. Contrary to previous studies showing low diversity of high-fidelity symbionts, we found significant variability within Cladocopium, which differed significantly across host species, reef sites, and temperature metrics. Locations with broader temperature ranges and a greater number of extreme accumulated heat stress events (measured as [&ge;] 8 Degree Heating Weeks) exhibited significantly higher prevalence and abundance of thermotolerant Cladocopium C116. Community structure also varied significantly by the number of DHW events per location, where a low level of disturbance (1-3 events) resulted in a relatively lower community diversity compared to sites with 3-6 and 6-9 events. The southernmost and coolest site (in terms of Maximum Monthly Mean) harboured the greatest Symbiodiniaceae community diversity, whereas the northernmost and warmest site harboured the greatest Symbiodiniaceae sequence diversity. These lines of evidence suggest that Porites may hold greater capacity to vary, and by extension modify, their symbiont community diversity than previously thought. This flexibility could contribute to the genus Porites long-term evolutionary success and relative resilience to global marine heatwaves."

In this study, we explore the evolutionary response of the social parasitic butterfly Phengaris teleius to its host ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, taking advantage of a unique opportunity: the reintroduction of the butterfly in the Netherlands thirty years ago. We compared the degree of host mimicry and behavioural performance of caterpillars between the reintroduced and the Polish source population. After about thirty generations, chemical and vibroacoustical signal profiles have diverged. Chemical mimicry remained limited during the pre-adoption phase for both groups; however, in the post-adoption phase, the source population showed significantly higher chemical similarity to their local hosts. In contrast, reintroduced pre-adoption caterpillars evolved vibroacoustic signals closely resembling local hosts, also resulting in a stronger response from their local host ants. This suggests that adoption is driven by acoustics and subsequently serves as a selective filter promoting post-entry chemical refinement. Behavioural data evince that despite the differences between the different communication channels, the combination of signals remains sufficient to ensure recognition and integration in both host-parasite systems. These results illustrate how social parasites involved in multisensory mimicry can rapidly recalibrate strategies to remain functional in new ecological contexts."

But if exposure to pesticides in the environment were to impair this homeostatic process, reproduction and population viability could be at risk. Focusing on an important insect pollinator, we conducted three complementary experiments exposing bumblebees to a pesticide under different temperature challenges and measuring the impacts on thermoregulatory ability and brood development. First, we reveal that pesticide-exposed individuals cannot maintain a stable thorax temperature, especially at lower temperatures. Second, reductions in body temperature are accompanied by behavioural changes and that pesticide-exposed colonies fail to maintain appropriate brood temperatures. Third, such collective impairment on brood thermoregulation (not the pesticide toxicity to offspring per se) leads to delayed pupal development and reduced adult population growth. Our study provides a valid mechanistic explanation for why terrestrial insects requiring brood thermoregulation have declined. With frequent extreme weather events forecasted, our findings have concerning implications for how populations will adequately persist and grow under current pesticide-use regimes with ramifications on pollination services."

Using microbiome predators (protists and nematodes) that shape microbiome composition and release N, we examined how interactions between their diversity and N addition affect Cannabis sativa growth. Microbiome predator addition overall boosted plant biomass by up to 53%, particularly under low N conditions, primarily by altering bacterial community composition and enriching functions related to carbon and N cycling. In turn, microbiome predator diversity had the strongest effect on biomass production, while N levels played a greater role in determining plant nutrient content. These findings suggest that increased microbiome predator diversity can reduce the plant's dependency on added N, showing the pivotal role of soil biodiversity in enhancing plant performance and serving as tools to mitigate N inputs."

In tropical agricultural lands such as Brazils Cerrado, understanding how wide-ranging wildlife species navigate these settings is critical for biodiversity conservation. We investigated space-use strategies of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), a large-herd forming species and ecological engineer listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, in a structurally heterogeneous landscape dominated by native vegetation remnants and industrial-scale farms under a legal regulatory framework of agricultural lands, private nature reserves and a national park. Using high-resolution GPS telemetry, we tracked 12 herds across this landscape from 2019 to 2022. Home ranges were estimated using multiple methods (AKDE 95%, KDE 50/95%, MCP 50/95/100%). Landscape composition was classified using MapBiomas land cover data. The herds with the largest ranges (up to 22,166.96 ha) occupied only native vegetation areas, with >99% natural cover, while herds with the smallest ranges (as low as 1,708.72 ha) occurred exclusively in agricultural areas (with >66% anthropogenic cover), and herds in mixed landscapes, composed of agricultural fields intermixed with patches of native vegetation, had ranges between both these extremes. Differences in range size and landscape cover patterns reflect behavioral plasticity in response to matrix configuration, crop availability, and native habitat structure. Our results reveal that landscape configuration and matrix permeability, not habitat amount alone, govern spatial responses in WLPs. Native vegetation patches (Legal Reserves and Permanent Preservation Areas) within crop mosaics functioned as key anchors for herd persistence outside protected areas, reinforcing the idea that such matrices can be conservation assets. Importantly, herds inhabiting agricultural areas exhibited spatial range contraction, which led to conflict with farmers due to their feeding on crops. Increasing peccary occupation in such landscapes is a growing conservation challenge in regions undergoing rapid agricultural expansion. Our work on the movement ecology of a species usually considered as requiring extensive areas of native vegetation indicates its resilience in landscapes dominated by humans. Understanding and managing the landscape matrix is essential for developing coexistence strategies that align biodiversity conservation goals with agricultural realities in the Anthropocene."

    "content": "Human-induced climate change has multiple public health impacts, including the expansion of the geographical range of vector-borne diseases. Pathogens such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, transmitted by Aedes mosquitos, can cause severe health outcomes ranging from acute febrile illness, chronic joint pain, to birth defects and even death. Evaluating the future risk of human population exposure is therefore crucial as large outbreaks could overwhelm healthcare systems. Europe, one of the fastest warming regions globally, harbours the competent mosquito vector Aedes albopictus in over 20 countries, making tropical Aedes-borne viruses an increasing threat to the continent, which has already experienced local outbreaks over the past two decades. Here we use an ecological niche modelling approach to assess past, present, and future risk of human population exposure to dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in Europe. Our results show that recent climate change has already increased the potential exposure to these viruses, particularly across the Mediterranean basin, which is a current hotspot for local outbreaks. Major metropolitan areas in Spain, France, Italy, and Croatia are by now located in at-risk areas, and this risk is projected to intensify and expand northward by mid-century. Under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, European areas ecologically suitable for Aedes-borne virus circulation could increase by up to ~70%, leading to an additional ~50 million people living in areas at risk by the end of the century. These findings underscore the urgent need for strengthened vector and epidemiological surveillance, as well as preparedness strategies across newly suitable regions to anticipate future public health threats associated with these arboviral diseases."

    "content": "A key challenge in ecosystem-based fisheries management is sustainably harvesting co-occurring species and populations that differ in their vulnerability to fishing. This challenge is exemplified in western Alaska Chinook salmon, where recent population declines have led to closures of in-river subsistence fisheries, but identifying the cause of these declines is limited by an inability to identify the river of origin for marine-caught fish in offshore fisheries that target more abundant species and populations. This problem is particularly acute for estimating the impacts of bycatch on individual salmon populations which have demographic independence but no genetic differentiation from which stock assignments can be made. Here we use machine learning approaches to assess the efficacy of using the microchemical history preserved in fish otoliths to assign individuals to their river of origin in western Alaska. We tested the classification ability of three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) combined with two time series smoothing techniques (Moving Average and Generalized Additive Models) to classify Chinook salmon to their river of origin using otolith time series data. Model accuracy ranged from 71.9% to 92.5%, with optimal performance achieved by Random Forest applied to GAM-smoothed data. Watershed-specific performance ranged from 86.8% to 93.7%, with most misclassifications occurring between spatially proximate Kuskokwim and Nushagak rivers. Raw predicted probabilities from classification algorithms were calibrated to reflect true class probabilities, enabling the incorporation of model results into decision analyses with explicit consideration of misclassification risk tolerance. The success of these models offers immediate utility for estimating marine mortality impacts across the regions three major river systems as well as an opportunity to understand commercial fisheries impacts on individual populations at substantially finer spatial scales than had been previously possible."

    "content": "As climate change accelerates, coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly exposed to co-occurring stressors whose combined effects are nonlinear and difficult to predict. Deoxygenation is a rapidly intensifying yet underrecognized threat to coral reefs that interacts with heat and acidification to alter coral physiology and stress resilience. However, the effects of hypoxia-related compound events on corals are largely unknown, underscoring the need for multi-stressor studies. Here, we conducted two extended-exposure experiments (12-17 days) across the coral species Porites furcata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, to disentangle the individual and combined effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) with either heat or acidification. We measured eight phenotypic traits related to growth, metabolism, and symbiosis health to test whether hypoxia imposes energetic constraints or other physiological stress that amplify the effects of heat or acidification. Standardized effect size analysis across 24 stressor-trait combinations revealed 13 additive, 10 synergistic, and only one antagonistic response. Hypoxia consistently suppressed dark respiration by 37-49% across species and altered photophysiology in the two Porites species, whereas acidification alone had minimal effects, particularly in S. siderea. Heat stress caused the most pronounced declines across nearly all traits, and when combined with hypoxia, it produced the highest number of synergistic interactions. In contrast, the combination of hypoxia and acidification largely resulted in additive responses, suggesting that independent physiological mechanisms underlie these effects. All corals showed strong metabolic depression under hypoxia which is likely beneficial as a short-term adaptive response but may impose energetic constraints in the long-term. These findings highlight deoxygenation as critical yet often overlooked drivers of coral reef vulnerability. More multi-stressor experiments across a range of species are urgently needed to improve predictions of reef resilience under future ocean conditions, where compound stress events are expected to become more frequent and severe."

We assessed how different gradients of drying-driven fragmentation and human impact extent determine local richness and the biological index scores by combining simulations with biomonitoring information.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a coalescent metacommunity model to simulate the exchange of individuals between local communities along synthetic drying river networks. These networks were subjected to different drying extent, drying intensity and human impact extent scenarios. Additionally, we considered two major characteristics for each simulated taxon: (i) tolerance to human impacts and (ii) dispersal strategy (flying, swimming, or drifting).\nC_LIO_LIFor each simulation, we obtained local richness and the biological index value.

As drying extent and intensity increased, drying-induced fragmentation significantly reduced the biological index performance. For example, with a 50% increase in drying extent, index performance fell over 70% and at high drying levels, this performance dropped more than 90%. This decay followed a convex pattern, with a marked drop in performance as soon as drying appeared in the catchment and leveling off at higher drying extents.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications: We show how simulations can be used to incorporate network fragmentation and metacommunity dynamics into the design and validation of biomonitoring tools, thereby increasing their efficiency.\nC_LI"

    "content": "Estuaries are ecologically vital yet highly impacted ecosystems that serve as transitional zones between land and sea. Monitoring their biodiversity is essential but challenging due to their dynamic nature and the transient presence of many species. Traditionally actinopterygian monitoring in these systems still relies on conventional and intrusive methods such as gill nets and trawls. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a non-invasive, multi-taxa alternative that can complement these traditional approaches. Here, we applied an eDNA-based metabarcoding approach to characterize vertebrate diversity in the Rance Estuary, located in the Brittany Region of France. Water samples were collected from five stations spanning marine to freshwater environments. Special attention was given to two stations located upstream and downstream of the tidal power plant (TPP) dam to assess its potential impact on ecological continuity. We detected a total of 124 distinct vertebrate MOTUs--comprising actinopterygians, birds, mammals, and amphibians. Taxonomic composition followed the estuarine gradient, with Jaccard dissimilarity increasing with distance from the sea and largely driven by species turnover. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity remained relatively stable across the vertebrate community, functional diversity revealed an increasing terrestrial influence. For actinopterygians, taxonomic diversity decreased upstream, whereas phylogenetic and functional diversity indicated fine-scale structuring, even among nearby stations. This approach enabled the development of biodiversity metrics and facilitated comparisons with previous actinopterygian monitoring surveys in the same area based on conventional methods (scientific fishing using nets and dredges). Our results emphasise the potential of eDNA for holistic estuarine biomonitoring and establish a valuable baseline for future non-invasive assessments."

    "content": "Microbial sulfate reduction is a cornerstone of marine sediment biogeochemistry, driving carbon remineralization and fueling the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Yet in zones of high methane flux, sulfate limitations may constrain the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that typically perform AOM. Although often overlooked, sulfur redox intermediates are readily utilized by diverse microorganisms, potentially driving AOM in sulfate-limited zones. To resolve the microbial mechanisms underlying cryptic sulfur cycling in such sediments, Monterey Canyon cold methane seeps were investigated through an integrated geochemical, isotopic, and metatranscriptomic approach. High-resolution electrochemical measurements confirmed intense sulfide production in seep sites, and long-term anoxic incubations were conducted with sediment from the SMTZ amended with elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or sulfate as the sole sulfur source, with or without methane. Over 650 days, sulfide accumulation was greatest in elemental sulfur treatments, followed by thiosulfate and sulfate; in all cases methane addition enhanced sulfide production. Isotopic measurements showed modest S-isotope fractionation indicating that the large fractionations typical of slow sulfate reduction were muted by additional sulfur transformations. In elemental sulfur treatments, isotopic and geochemical patterns suggested that disproportionation was unlikely. Metatranscriptomes revealed broad expression of sox genes and abundant dsr/apr across treatments, along with thiosulfate-linked phs upregulation. While ANME-2c and SEEP-SRB2 activity increased with methane, transcriptomic and isotopic data together highlighted the roles of Desulfocapsaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Sulfurovaceae lineages in mediating sulfur transformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate how cryptic sulfur cycling may sustain microbial communities in sulfate-depleted deep-sea sediments and contribute to AOM."

ALAN increased M. aquaticum height and total biomass, but had no effect on native species growth. In feeding assays, P. canaliculata consumed all three native species but consistently avoided M. aquaticum under both light treatments. C. chinensis showed no feeding in no-choice assays, but in choice assays, consumed H. verticillata and M. spicatum under No-ALAN and only M. spicatum under ALAN. In community mesocosms, P. canaliculata reduced native macrophyte biomass by 48.0% under No-ALAN and 87.2% under ALAN without affecting M. aquaticum. This selective feeding increased M. aquaticums proportional biomass, with a stronger effect under ALAN than No-ALAN.

Introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand from Britain in the early 1900s to aid coastal land reclamation, it became a conservation concern by the 1960s, prompting control efforts in the South Island from the 1970s.\n\nThis study presents a detailed S. anglicus eradication case study from the Marlborough Sounds, where detections are nearing zero. We model changes in detection probability over time in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound, a complex estuarine catchment. We aim to inform control efforts and assess the effectiveness of ongoing management, by evaluating the probability of non-detection as a proxy for functional eradication.\n\nUsing data from the Department of Conservation (DOC), we analysed detections across 79 search blocks between 2013 and 2024. A generalised linear mixed model was used to generate predicted detections through to 2040, using a modified dataset with pseudo-zero values for probable absences. The data were modelled as presence/absence with a binomial distribution, to identify the first year with a <0.01 probability of a positive detection (upper 99% confidence limit). Results suggest that by 2032, the likelihood of further detections under current management practices is remote, and that functional eradication may have occurred. We interpret this decline in detection probability as indicative of management success.\n\nModel outputs can support decision-making as to when active surveillance might reasonably be ceased. To accelerate the tail-end of eradication efforts, we recommend intensifying search effort and widening delimitations within the catchment over the next five years, to ensure removal of any remaining individuals. We also propose the use of environmental DNA as a cost-effective backstop for after operational wind-down.\n\nImplications for ManagersO_LIOur modelling predicts that S. anglicus detections in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound should decline to levels consistent with functional eradication by 2032, and may render continued manual surveillance uneconomical after this date.\nC_LIO_LIFull, regular and repeated surveillance of suitable habitats is needed within a five-year intensive monitoring period at the tail-end phase of eradication, as detections approach zero and managers consider withdrawal.\nC_LIO_LIWhile statistical analyses support eradication management decisions, absolute certainty of absence is unattainable. Decisions must balance technical feasibility with practical risk tolerance.\nC_LIO_LIEnvironmental DNA could provide an effective post-withdrawal monitoring tool, to allay the risk of re-invasion.\nC_LI"

    "content": "Climate warming is altering the timing of seasonal growth in cold-temperate and boreal ecosystems, with potential consequences for forests on multiple continents. It has been hypothesized that in a warming climate, earlier growth in spring might lead to a longer growing season and thus higher annual total growth. However, whether the period of active growth is longer in a warming climate is unclear, as is whether changes in growth rate might reinforce or offset the effect of changing growing season length in modulating annual total growth. Understanding responses in growth to warming is crucial to projecting forest dynamics under future climate change. To address this, we experimentally warmed (by +1.62 and 3.26 {degrees}C on average) open-air southern boreal forest plots for 14 years (2010 to 2023) and measured juvenile height growth from spring until fall for 20 tree and shrub species, with a total of 11,565 individual-year growth trajectories. Across all species and in various canopy (open, closed) and rainfall (ambient, reduced) contexts, experimental warming consistently advanced the timing of height growth (4.32 days per 3 {degrees}C warming). However, species differed in their annual total growth responses. Evergreen gymnosperms such as spruce, fir, and pine tended to exhibit suppressed annual total growth under warming (-15.8% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by a shorter duration of active growth, despite an earlier start, with little change in relative growth rate. In contrast, deciduous angiosperms and non-native shrubs often show enhanced annual total growth under warming (19.3 and 37.4% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by faster rate, longer duration, or a combination of both. More broadly, species with a more conservative lifestyle responded less positively in the duration and rate of growth, thus placing them at a disadvantage under warming. These contrasting responses challenge assumptions that an earlier start of the growing season universally enhances growth and highlight how warming may shift both the timing and pace of growth and thus alter community composition within mixed-species forests."

    "content": "The location at which a species assemblage is observed can be uncertain, for example in fisheries where catch composition is recorded accurately but location data may be coarse or inaccurate. In such cases, spatial signals in observed species compositions can help identify and refine uncertain locations. This study explored three approaches for location estimation using species composition data: 1) a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that jointly estimates species distributions and location uncertainty, 2) an inverse prediction method that uses a fitted SDM to identify the most likely location given new species data, and 3) the direct modeling of location as the response variable. Each approach requires a subset of observations with accurate locations to quantify the spatial patterns in species distributions. All three methods were useful and reasonably accurate: for the simulated data the average distance error (distance to true location) was 15% the size of the domain, and for the real data this error was 20-100 km. When only some locations are uncertain, the hierarchical approach is valuable due to its integrated estimation of location and species parameters. When many locations are uncertain, the other approaches seem more suitable. Inverse prediction is ideal when prior information is available to constrain the location estimation. Direct modelling (although causally spurious) is well suited to large datasets, with multivariate random forests often providing the most accurate location estimates. These methods can enhance spatial data quality in ecological monitoring and help develop tools for improving inaccurate or deliberately misreported fishing locations."

    "content": "Coral gastrovascular cavities (GVCs) host diverse microorganisms and, as semi-closed compartments, are characterized by elevated nutrient concentrations and pronounced diel fluctuations in oxygen (O2) and pH. However, their broader chemical microenvironment and associated microbial activities remain poorly understood. Here, we provide direct evidence for active anaerobic metabolism in the GVC by measuring hydrogen (H2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) production, indicative of microbial fermentation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification. Changes in GVC H2 concentrations after feeding suggest that feeding modulates substrate availability, which in turn influences microbial activity in this compartment. In bleached corals, the GVC remained consistently hypoxic and acidic, and anaerobic metabolic processes persisted across the diel cycle. These patterns suggest a shift in energy and nutrient cycling pathways within the bleached coral holobiont. Together, our findings identify the GVC as a dynamic site of microbial activity that may play an important role in holobiont carbon and nitrogen cycling, with potential implications for nutrient balance and coral resilience."

    "content": "1. Microclimates are critical for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behaviour, physiology, and species distributions. However, traditional physical heat-balance models for predicting ground temperatures in microhabitats often exhibit biases due to unaccounted environmental complexities and poorly constrained parameters. These limitations can hinder ecological research and conservation planning, particularly in the context of climate change.\n\n2. In this study, we demonstrate how high-resolution drone-based mapping and machine learning can improve the accuracy of microclimate models. Using drone imagery, we generated detailed environmental maps, including solar radiation, vegetation indices, and skyview factors, to parameterize a physical heat-balance model. Validation with thermal maps derived from drone-mounted infrared cameras revealed systematic errors in the physical models predictions, including over- and underestimations under specific environmental conditions. To address these errors, we applied a random forest machine learning model to predict and correct biases in new prediction maps.\n\n3. Our results show that machine learning reduced mean absolute errors by over 30% and mean square errors by 50%, while consistently narrowing the range of prediction inaccuracies. Key factors driving biases, such as vegetation cover, solar radiation, and height above ground, were identified, offering valuable insights for improving physical models. The machine learning corrections not only improved accuracy but also highlighted parameters and processes that were previously underrepresented or oversimplified in traditional models.\n\n4. These findings illustrate the potential of combining machine learning with physical modelling to enhance microclimate predictions. This approach provides ecologists and conservation practitioners with a powerful tool to generate accurate, fine-scale microclimate maps, enabling better understanding of species responses to climate change and informing climate-resilient habitat management and conservation strategies."

Here, we show in mice that, when the brain is forced into a minimal responsive state by an anesthetic, a rapid activation of EphB1 receptor occurs in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus and contributes to promote the emergence of consciousness by activating the VPM glutamatergic neuron (VPM\n    <sup>\n     Glu\n    </sup>\n    )\u00a0\u2192\u00a0primary somatosensory cortex glutamatergic neuron pathway. The ephrinB-EphB1 receptor signaling excites VPM\n    <sup>\n     Glu\n    </sup>\n    neurons through phosphorylation of NR2B, a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), at tyrosine-1472 (Y1472) and disinhibits VPM\n    <sup>\n     Glu\n    </sup>\n    neurons through ubiquitin degradation of potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2). The EphB1/NR2B Y1472 phosphorylation and EphB1/KCC2 ubiquitin degradation are two independent mechanisms in the process of emergence from anesthesia and occur independent of the molecular targets of anesthesia.

However, how do eukaryotes, which express monocistronic messages, achieve the same regulation? Previously, we demonstrated that yeast uses RNA operons, i.e., mRNAs assembled in trans (transperons), to control multiple cellular pathways such as the heat shock response (HSR). As the HSR is conserved from yeast to mammals, we used single-molecule RNA labeling and pulldown techniques to demonstrate that mammalian heat shock protein (HSP) mRNAs also form operons upon transcription during heat stress. HSP RNA operon formation is dependent on the heat shock factor 1 transcription factor and intra- and interchromosomal interactions between the HSP genes. Work in yeast identified a conserved RNA sequence motif and histone H4 functions that act downstream thereof to regulate transperon assembly. Our work highlights the evolutionarily conserved regulation of the HSR and for RNA operons in eukaryotic gene regulation.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

    "content": "Abstract\nThermal and biogeochemical states of the North Atlantic Ocean are affected on seasonal to decadal timescales by atmospheric forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). An NAO\u2013based composite approach is applied to an Earth system model to reveal the fast and slow responses of the ocean to atmospheric impulse forcing. Over the seasonal boundary layer, the atmosphere induces a \u201cfast\u201d, seasonal ocean response driven by anomalies in the air\u2013sea flux, vertical entrainment and Ekman transport. This fast response to an NAO+ ${+}$ anomaly results in negative temperature and positive carbon and nutrient anomalies over the subpolar gyre, and positive temperature and negative carbon and nutrient anomalies over the subtropical gyre. The \u201cslow\u201d response on inter\u2010annual timescales involves changes in meridional overturning, tracer transport and entrainment. The slow response leads to a redistribution of anomalies between subpolar and subtropical regions, generating opposing\u2013signed tracer anomalies in the subpolar and subtropical North Atlantic Oceans. These ocean responses also involve changes in the mixed\u2010layer depth, as well as the associated changes in entrainment and turbulent mixing rates, which are particularly important for the carbon and nutrient responses given their large vertical gradients. Modifications in nutrient concentrations subsequently influence biological activity and biomass production. These thermal, carbon and nutrient responses to atmospheric events linked to the NAO can persist for up to a decade, often characterized by opposing\u2013signed temperature and carbon anomalies, along with contrasting changes in the subtropical and subpolar gyres."

The identification of the various detoxification strategies developed by fungi, and the molecular targets of these compounds is limited in Basidiomycetes because of the lack of genetic tools. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a direct genetic strategy in the white\u2010rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. A library of P. chrysosporium UV mutants was generated and screened to isolate mutants resistant to Bagassa guianensis wood extractives (BWE). Wood extractives contribute to B. guianensis wood durability, and resistance to those extractives confers to the mutants a better ability to mineralise wood sawdust. This resistance phenotype is due to causal mutation(s) in the gene coding for an ortholog of the human DENND6, a protein involved in endocytic recycling. Using in silico and in\u00a0vivo assays, we identified that moracin N, found in BWE, has antifungal activity likely by binding onto the wild type PcDENND6 protein but not onto the mutated variant."

We investigated the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in two rivers and surface waters of Young Sound, NE Greenland\u2014a high Arctic fjord where glacial runoff contributes to low primary productivity and increasing heterotrophy. Using ultra\u2010high\u2010performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2010qTOF\u2010MS), we conducted a non\u2010targeted analysis of solid\u2010phase extracted DOM (SPE\u2010DOM). We expected DOM composition to differ between the two studied rivers (Tyroler and Zackenberg), which contrast in length, glacial water source, and catchment characteristics, and to reflect the salinity gradient in fjord waters. Both rivers carried a strong glacial imprint, with DOM enriched in aliphatic constituents typically associated with higher bioavailability, yet the proglacial Zackenberg River also exhibited unique compositional features that were more unsaturated and aromatic in character. Comparisons along a salinity gradient, from river plumes to outer fjord and open sea, revealed limited contrasts beyond the most glacially influenced section, with SPE\u2010DOM composition showing high similarity across sites. Although multiple factors may contribute to this similarity, dilution and rapid processing of glacially derived DOM are likely to play a role. While further research is needed to understand carbon cycling in high Arctic fjords, our findings offer relevant insight into the molecular characteristics and potential ecological roles of DOM in this environment."

    "content": "Abstract\nKnowledge of the distribution of soil thermal properties is important for understanding subsurface hydrological and biogeochemical processes. This study describes and evaluates quick thermal profiling (QTP), a new measurement technique aimed at providing rapid, depth\u2010resolved measurements of soil thermal inertia at numerous locations across the landscape. A cylindrical probe with temperature sensors at multiple depths is quickly inserted into the ground, and soil thermal inertia is estimated from how quickly the probe temperature equilibrates with the soil. To this end, a finite volume heat transfer model is used to generate temperature equilibration time series across combinations of controlling factors, and a gridded search inversion approach is applied to infer soil thermal inertia. Field tests in the Arctic indicate that QTP measurements have a minimum uncertainty of 0.14\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0K\u22121\u00a0s\u22121/2 and covary with dual\u2010probe heat pulse thermal analyzer measurements (concordance correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.56) with a root\u2010mean\u2010square error of 0.40\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0K\u22121\u00a0s\u22121/2. Besides demonstrating the value of QTP for estimating thermal inertia, this study identifies various sources of measurement uncertainty, particularly probe\u2010soil contact resistance and frictional heating. Further, analysis of soil samples indicates that thermal inertia can be used to estimate thermal conductivity and dry bulk density in the studied area, although such inferences are highly site\u2010specific. Overall, the QTP method holds promise to generate thermal inertia data products and to complement other characterization approaches for advancing understanding of soil properties across far more locations than is currently possible."

    "content": "Abstract\nDiapycnal mixing supplies nutrients to the euphotic zone, which in oligotrophic regions may substantially support rates of new production. However, the consensus view that diapycnal nutrient fluxes support new production within the entire euphotic zone is challenged by deep living autotrophs that likely consume some, if not all, of the diapycnal flux at depth. Quantifying how much of the diapycnal nitrate flux is trapped by biological consumption immediately above the nitracline remains challenging and the implications of nutrient trapping for comparisons of cross\u2010nitracline diapycnal fluxes with euphotic zone integrals of new production remains unclear. It is increasingly important therefore to determine where in the euphotic zone the diapycnal flux has impact. In this study, a simple assessment is presented of the strength of the \u201cnutrient trap,\u201d which is attributed to picoeukaryotes, a widely distributed group of autotrophic picoplankton found in the subtropical and tropical ocean. This study finds significant potential for the total consumption of diapycnal nutrient fluxes within a few meters of the nitracline, thus largely negating the significance of vertical diffusive fluxes for processes occurring at shallower depths. These results suggest that the significance of diapycnal nutrient fluxes for integrated productivity estimates is lower than generally assumed. Yet, although diapycnal fluxes cannot be entirely discounted from nutrient budgets due to seasonality in the consumption of such fluxes at depth, this likely makes harder current modeling efforts to constrain future ocean productivity where predictions of increased stratification generally favor greater reliance upon the diapycnal pathway to support production."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nGlobal change is accelerating biological invasions, making it crucial to understand how species adapt in new environments to improve management strategies. Genomic data provide valuable insights into adaptation through genotype\u2010environment association (GEA) studies, which identify genes and biological processes tied to invasion success, and through geometric genomic offset (gGO) statistics, which estimate genetic (mal)adaptation to new environments. Here, we investigate genetic adaptation in the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii using novel genomic resources and statistical methods. We use a new chromosome\u2010level genome assembly and data from 37 populations, combining publicly available and newly generated pooled and individual sequencing data, analysed with an enhanced version of BayPass software, tailored for such hybrid datasets. First, we identify genomic regions showing genetic differentiation between native and invasive populations. Then, using a GEA with 29 environmental covariates, we estimate the gGO between the source environments and the invaded areas, shedding light on the potential adaptive challenges D.\u2009suzukii faced during previous invasions. In addition, we estimate gGO for geographical areas not yet invaded to predict future invasion risks, and identify regions from which preadapted populations may originate. Our results reveal numerous genomic regions associated with the invasive status from genome scans. However, when considering broader patterns of adaptation to specific environmental variables through gGO analyses, we find that D.\u2009suzukii populations likely faced only limited adaptive challenges across their major invasion range, while certain uninvaded regions still remain at high risk of future invasion. Our study offers significant insights into D.\u2009suzukii adaptation and provides a practical population genomics framework to predict biological invasions, applicable to various species."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nFairyflies (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Mymaridae) are a diverse but taxonomically understudied group of parasitoid wasps that attack the eggs of other insects. Being among the very smallest of all insects, they are often ignored in biodiversity surveys despite being one of the most abundant microhymenoptera in many habitats. The traditional approach of morphological species delimitation can be challenging due to their minute size and meticulous slide\u2010mounting technique. Ways to accelerate their discovery are needed. We conducted the first large\u2010scale study of Mymaridae in temperate forests, combining DNA megabarcoding and the large\u2010scale integrative taxonomy (LIT) workflow to describe their diversity. We obtained COI barcodes from 2098 specimens and used ASAP and RESL for species delimitation. Between 42 and 114 molecular clusters were delimited. Reducing morphological validation to only 9% of the sample enabled accurate delimitation while limiting time and effort. We confirmed the presence of 55 species, including many potentially new to science. The LIT workflow was effective for Mymaridae, although cryptic diversity remains unresolved in some large clusters, especially in the genera Alaptus and Anagrus, where high haplotype diversity and morphological ambiguity suggest additional hidden species. DNA reference databases proved unreliable, with less than 1% correct species matches, highlighting the taxonomic gap for this group. Nonetheless, we contributed 16 new identified reference barcodes to public databases and added new provincial and national species records for Canada. Our results demonstrate the value of combining molecular and morphological data in a standardised workflow and underscore the importance of improving reference databases for effective biodiversity assessments of dark taxa like microhymenoptera."

    "content": "<p>by Madeleine Ammar, Laurel Fogarty, Anne Kandler</p>\n\nOne of the most controversial and actively debated questions about both human and non-human animal culture concerns its relationship with adaptation \u2013 under what circumstances might we expect culture, and the ability to learn socially from others, to be beneficial, and favored by natural selection? Existing theory posits that the benefit of social learning depends on the rate at which the environment changes, and recent work has shown that this relationship is mediated by how much information an individual can retain over time - by memory. Based on extensive ethnographic research, vertical learning\u2014social learning from parent to offspring\u2014appears to be an extremely salient and important type of social learning. Here we develop large-scale agent-based simulation models to investigate the evolutionary relationship between vertical social learning in particular and the memory and retention of cultural information.\nWe show that the benefit of vertical learning depends on how quickly those information is forgotten and on the exact way in which individuals innovate. This work points to the importance of a complex interplay between the size of cultural repertoires, the benefits of cultural preservation, changing selective environments, and the mechanism of innovation - none of which can be fully understood in isolation."

We introduce a benchmarking framework that quantifies three aspects of interpretability: attribution recall, attribution precision, and stability, and apply it to deep learning models trained on UK Biobank genotypes for standing height prediction. After quality control, feed-forward neural networks were trained on more than half a million autosomal variants from approximately 300 thousand participants and evaluated using four attribution algorithms (Saliency, Gradient SHAP, DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients) with and without SmoothGrad noise averaging. Attribution recall was assessed using synthetic spike-in variants with known additive, dominant, recessive, and epistatic effects, enabling direct measurement of sensitivity to diverse genetic architectures. Attribution precision estimated specificity using an equal number of null decoy variants that preserved allele structure while disrupting genotype-phenotype correspondence. Stability was measured by the consistency of variant-level attributions across an ensemble of independently trained models. SmoothGrad increased average recall across effect types by approximately 0.16 at the top 1% of the most highly attributed variants and improved average precision by about 0.06 at the same threshold, while stability remained comparable with median relative standard deviations of 0.4 to 0.5 across methods. Among the evaluated attribution methods, Saliency achieved the highest composite score, indicating that its simple gradient formulation provided the best overall balance of recall, precision, and stability."

    "content": "<p>by Gaston Sivori, Tomoki Fukai</p>\n\nOne of the remarkable properties of cortical neurons is their innate ability to detect spike patterns in continuous but noisy information streams. As animals learn behaviorally relevant information quickly, pattern detection by neurons should also be rapid. However, how pattern-selective neuronal responses rapidly develop, tune, and remain robust has not been fully understood. Here, we propose a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule to learn patterned synaptic inputs rapidly. Our rule facilitates intracellular \u201cself-supervised\u201d learning of intermittently and repeatedly co-activated presynaptic-neuron communities, as in a machine-learning-based rule derived previously for temporal pattern segmentation. Importantly, this model proposes that a spike-triggered transient increase in somatodendritic coupling dramatically boosts the crediting of synapses responsible for the learned response. This boosting effect is essential for rapid pattern learning of single neurons at a high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, we demonstrate in recurrent networks how the rule recruits pre-configured cell assemblies for even faster, few-shot learning of multiple patterns. Our results illuminate the self-supervisory role of backpropagating action potentials for rapid pattern learning."

    "content": "<p>by Zarin Akter, Jawad Ibn Ahad, Md. Mutasim Farhan, Riasat Khan</p>\n\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment, which significantly impacts working-class populations, necessitating accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional DR classification relies on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models and extensive preprocessing. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction, followed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for refined embedding representation. The extracted feature vectors are structured as a graph, where GCN enhances embeddings before classification. The proposed model incorporates quality assessment by predicting a confidence score through a dedicated fully connected layer, trained to align with ground truth quality using binary cross-entropy loss. Uncertainty estimation is achieved by calculating the variance across multiple stochastic passes, providing a measure of the model\u2019s prediction reliability. We evaluate the proposed DR detection approach on APTOS2019, Messidor-2, and EyePACS datasets, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Using MobileViT as the main feature extractor, we reached a remarkable 98.45% accuracy, 98.45% F1-Score, and 98.06% Kappa on the APTOS2019 dataset. The DenseNet-169 proved to be the best backbone of the pipeline for the Messidor-2 dataset, with an accuracy of 94.90%, F1-Score of 94.87%, and Kappa of 93.63%. Additionally, for external validation, the model demonstrated strong generalization capability on the EyePACS dataset, where DenseNet-169 achieved 97.38% accuracy, 97.37% F1-Score, and 96.72% Kappa, while MobileViT obtained 96.02% accuracy, 96.02% F1-Score, and 95.03% Kappa. Our innovative architecture incorporates uncertainty estimation and quality assessment techniques, enabling accurate confidence scores and enhancing the model\u2019s reliability in clinical environments. Furthermore, to strengthen interpretability and facilitate clinical validation, Grad-CAM heatmaps were employed to demonstrate the significance of different input regions on the model\u2019s predictions."

Extracting DDIs from biomedical literature plays an essential role in pharmacovigilance, yet remains difficult due to data sparsity and high annotation costs. This study presents BioMCL-DDI, a novel few-shot learning framework that integrates meta-learning with contrastive embedding strategies to enable efficient DDI extraction under limited supervision. BioMCL-DDI jointly optimizes prototype-based classification and supervised contrastive representation learning within a unified architecture. The model captures both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, enhancing its generalization in sparse biomedical settings. We evaluate BioMCL-DDI on three benchmark datasets: DDI-2013, DrugBank, and the more recent TAC 2018 DDI Extraction corpus. The model achieves F1 scores of 87.80% on DDI-2013, 86.00% on DrugBank, and 74.85%/74.82% on the two official test sets of TAC 2018, consistently outperforming competitive baselines. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource scenarios. BioMCL-DDI provides a scalable and effective solution for DDI extraction from biomedical texts, with strong potential for integration into clinical decision support systems and biomedical knowledge bases.

Augustin, Patrick M. Boyle</p>\n\nCardiac fibrosis is a pathological condition associated with many cardiovascular diseases. Atrial fibrosis leads to reduced atrial function, resulting in diminished blood flow and an increased risk of stroke. This reduced function arises from altered myocardial electrophysiological and mechanical properties. Identifying the relative importance of these fibrosis-associated properties can reveal the most significant determinants of left atrial function impairment. In this study, we used a computational framework to investigate the relative importance of various fibrosis-associated properties. Our model, a 3D electromechanical framework coupled with a 0D circulatory model, incorporated patient-specific geometries and fibrosis distributions from clinical imaging data. Nine parameters related to fibrotic remodeling (conduction velocity, ion channel expression levels, cell- and tissue-scale contractility, and stiffness) were analyzed using two sensitivity analysis schemes: a one-factor-at-a-time setup, allowing for analysis of isolated effects, and a fractional factorial design, enabling examination of combined effects. As output, we tracked various metrics derived from model-predicted pressure-volume loops. Impairment of L-type calcium current (I<sub>CaL</sub>) was most detrimental (up to 64% reduction in A-loop area of the left atrial pressure-volume relationship, quantifying work performed during atrial contraction). Conversely, reduced inward rectifier current (I<sub>K1</sub>) led to improved atrial function (up to 27% increase in A-loop area). Detailed analysis of spatiotemporal distributions linked these effects to changes in intracellular calcium handling. Fractional factorial design analysis revealed that combination with other parameter changes blunted the impact of reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> but amplified the impact of reduced I<sub>K1</sub>. Future research focusing on I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub> could be highly significant for clinical and scientific advances. Modeling work can help evaluate left atrial function among larger patient cohorts, focusing on strain analysis. Our work could also be extended to spatiotemporal simulations of blood flow and thrombosis, shedding light onto the mechanisms underlying atriogenic stroke."

    "content": "<p>by Xinyu Wang, Huimin Liu, Xiaoman Wang, Ben Zhou, Haiqing Tang, Shanshan Pang</p>\n\nLysosomes are critical hubs for both cellular degradation and signal transduction, yet their function declines with age. Aging is also associated with significant changes in lysosomal morphology, but the physiological significance of these alterations remains poorly understood. Here, we find that a subset of aged lysosomes undergo enlargement resulting from lysosomal dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i>. Importantly, this enlargement is not merely a passive consequence of functional decline but represents an active adaptive response to preserve lysosomal degradation capacity. Blocking lysosomal enlargement exacerbates the impaired degradation of dysfunctional lysosomes. Mechanistically, lysosomal enlargement is a transcriptionally regulated process governed by the longevity transcription factor SKN-1, which responds to lysosomal dysfunction by restricting fission and thereby induces lysosomal enlargement. Furthermore, in long-lived germline-deficient animals, SKN-1 activation induces lysosomal enlargement, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation and contributing to longevity. These findings unveil a morphological adaptation that safeguards lysosomal homeostasis, with potential relevance for lysosomal aging and life span."

Cell assemblies have generally been studied in relation to specific stimuli or actions, but this approach does not readily extend to more abstract constructs. An alternative approach is to assess cell assemblies without making reference to external variables, and instead focus on internal brain processes\u2014by assessing assemblies by their endogenous ability to effectively elicit specific responses in downstream (\u201creader\u201d) neurons. However, this compelling idea currently lacks experimental support. Here, we provide evidence for assembly\u2013reader communication. Large-scale cross-structural recordings in rats revealed that reader activation was genuinely collective, functionally selective, yet flexible, implementing both pattern separation and completion. These processes occurred at the time scale of membrane integration, synaptic plasticity, and gamma oscillations. Finally, assembly\u2013reader couplings were selectively modified upon associative learning, indicating that they were plastic and could become bound to behaviorally relevant variables. These results support cell assemblies as an endogenous mechanism for brain function."

    "content": "Memory consolidation tends to be less robust in childhood than adulthood. However, little is known about the corresponding functional differences in the developing brain that may underlie age-related differences in retention of memories over time. This study examined system-level memory consolidation of object-scene associations after learning (immediate delay), one night of sleep (short delay), as well as 2 weeks (long delay) in 5- to 7-year-old children (n=49) and in young adults (n=39), as a reference group with mature consolidation systems. Particularly, we characterized how functional neural activation and reinstatement of neural patterns change over time, assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with representational similarity analysis (RSA). Our results showed that memory consolidation in children was less robust and strong (i.e. more forgetting) compared to young adults. Contrasting correctly retained remote vs. recent memories across time delay, children showed less upregulation in posterior parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum than adults. In addition, both children and adults showed a decrease in scene-specific neural reinstatement over time, indicating time-related decay of detailed differentiated memories. At the same time, we observed the emergence of generic gist-like neural representations in prefrontal brain regions uniquely in children, indicating qualitative difference in memory trace in children. Taken together, 5- to 7-year-old children, compared to young adults, show less robust memory consolidation, possibly due to difficulties in engaging in differentiated neural representations in neocortical mnemonic regions during retrieval of remote memories, coupled with relying more on gist-like generic neural representations."

    "content": "Fear responses to perceived danger are critical for survival, as they prompt the individual to respond to threats and avoid harm. However, excessive fear can impede normal biological processes and become harmful. This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying two distinct forms of fear\u2014phasic and sustained\u2014in male and female mice, with a focus on the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling. Phasic fear is characterized by immediate responses to clear threats, while sustained fear is driven by ambiguous or uncertain cues and persists longer. Using rodent models, we found that sustained fear, modeled by partial fear conditioning, induced greater arousal and BNST activity in males, especially during ambiguous threat cues. In contrast, females exhibited reduced BNST and BNST<sup>CRF</sup> activity, highlighting significant sex differences in fear learning and expression. Additionally, CRF is crucial for appropriate fear response in females, as CRF knockdown led to increased fear responses, but had no effect in males. These sex-specific differences could help inform the development of targeted treatments for anxiety and trauma-related disorders, which disproportionately affect women."

This study diagnoses mortality trends in EM\u2010DAT, the largest public disaster mortality database, using a nonstationary Poisson\u2010Generalized Pareto statistical model. Several trends in frequency and/or intensity of deadly hazards are identified and discussed. Most notably, Asian floods and storms became less deadly and frequent due to reduced vulnerability via increased adaptive capacity, which is conservatively estimated to have saved 350,000 (95% CI: 220,000\u2013560,000) lives.

    "content": "Abstract\nUrban ecosystems are structured by multiple anthropogenic stressors, yet despite the increasing extent and rate of urbanization worldwide, the ecological consequences of excessive road salt application and other urban phenomena remain poorly resolved. To advance understanding of these drivers and their effects on aquatic ecosystems, we collected zooplankton and associated environmental data from 50 permanent stormwater management ponds in Brampton, Canada. Generalized linear regression analysis revealed that zooplankton richness and diversity were strongly influenced by chloride and nitrate, with chloride having a strong negative effect. Community uniqueness was greatest in ponds with elevated calcium, while the presence of fish and higher pH levels promoted community homogeneity. Redundancy analysis showed that zooplankton beta\u2010diversity was mainly impacted by water chemistry, which explained the most variation in zooplankton composition (9.2%), whereas watershed impervious cover explained none (0%). Surprisingly, despite strong negative impacts of chloride from road salts on multiple dimensions of zooplankton diversity, structural equation models failed to detect any direct or indirect effects of impervious land cover on zooplankton diversity mediated by its influence of water quality on other biotic factors (e.g., fish presence). These findings highlight the limitations of using impervious surfaces as a proxy for the impacts of urbanization on aquatic ecosystem condition but also suggest that reducing salinization may offer meaningful benefits to biodiversity even in densely populated areas."

    "content": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the important RNA modifications that affect RNA abundance and function and has also been implicated in viral infection. In this study, we identify a number of m6A modification sites within human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) RNAs, particularly in the RNA of the Tax oncogene. We demonstrate that YTH domain family, member 2 (YTHDF2), a key m6A reader protein that binds m6A-modified RNAs and influences RNA metabolism, is required for HTLV-1 replication in both de novo and persistently infected cells. Mechanistically, YTHDF2 interacts with and stabilizes Tax RNA in an m6A-dependent manner, thereby promoting Tax-driven HTLV-1 replication. Importantly, YTHDF2 activates oncogenic cellular pathways and promotes proliferation in HTLV-1 infected cells, aligning with the functions of Tax. Overall, our findings characterize YTHDF2 as a host factor critical to HTLV-1 RNA metabolism and viral propagation, offering novel insights into the understanding of HTLV-1 life cycle and the development of targeted interventions."

    "content": "Mitophagy selectively removes depolarised and damaged mitochondria, promoting cell viability. Some members of the Orthoflavivirus genus activate mitophagy to allow extended replication times in a surviving cell, while others inhibit mitophagy to favour viral spread. Viral genome replication is catalysed by non-structural protein 5 (NS5), the largest and most conserved protein in the orthoflaviviruses (OFVs). Here, we used quantitative proteomics to identify host cell interactors of Zika virus (ZIKV), Usutu virus (USUV), and West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 proteins. A total of 141 cellular interactors were found, of which 26 were common to all three NS5s. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of those proteins most significantly enriched revealed putative proviral and restriction activities associated. Knockdown of host myoferlin and LGALS3BP led to decreases in the virus titres, suggesting that both positively promote viral replication. Silencing of mitophagy-related prohibitin 2 (PHB2) resulted in significant increases in ZIKV and USUV titres, as well as intracellular levels of genomic RNA. Supporting a connection between this antiviral behaviour and mitophagy, an inhibitor of this pathway also led to larger virus titres and genomic viral RNA. During an infection, PHB2 protein levels gradually decreased, becoming transiently undetectable, and suggesting that it is specifically targeted and degraded by virus-mediated activities. Ectopic expression of NS5 alone did not affect PHB2 intracellular abundance, however a significant decrease was observed in cells expressing the viral protease NS2B/NS3. Its elimination, however, was more pronounced in cells where both viral enzymes were co-expressed, suggesting that NS5 could be assisting PHB2 recognition by NS2B/NS3. Overall, our results support that PHB2 is an orthoflaviviral restriction factor which is targeted for degradation to favour viral replication."

    "content": "Emerging evidence supports a bidirectional gut-pancreas axis in which microbial dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and altered metabolite fluxes contribute to pancreatogenic diabetes (T3cDM). Whether gut microbial changes reflect systemic metabolic disturbances or primarily arise from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) remains unclear. We profiled the gut microbiome of 48 outpatients with T3cDM, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and healthy controls. Genus-level 16S rRNA data were analysed using cross-validated LASSO logistic regression and patient-specific community metabolic models. T3cDM showed reduced -diversity and distinct {beta}-diversity compared with T1DM and controls. Key compositional shifts included enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae (notably Escherichia-Shigella) and Streptococcaceae in T3cDM. LASSO models discriminated T3cDM from T1DM (AUC 0.867; accuracy 0.818), highlighting Blautia, Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus, Clostridium, and Faecalibacterium as predictors. Metabolic modelling indicated elevated Escherichia-Shigella growth in T3cDM and disease-specific metabolite fluxes. Gut microbial shifts in T3cDM predominantly reflect EPI rather than systemic metabolic disturbances characteristic of T1DM, underscoring the central role of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in shaping the gut microbiome and its metabolic activity."

    "content": "The development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved the prognosis of people living with HIV (PLWH). However, reservoirs of latent viruses represent a major barrier to achieving a complete cure of HIV infection. To overcome the burden of viral latency, the \"Shock-and-Kill\" strategy employs latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to reactivate the virus and thus render it susceptible to elimination. Existing LRAs are not optimal and there is an unmet need for improvement. By screening a small molecule library, we identified the novel LRA candidate 2-HSB (2-hydrido-2,2'-spirobi(1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphole)) which not only reactivates latent HIV provirus but also induces specific cytopathic effects in both monocytic and T lymphocytic latent HIV reservoirs. Thus, this novel compound represents a dual \"shock and kill\" agent, unlike known LRAs which are limited to the \"shock\". The probable involvement of HIV-1 tat protein may account for its selectivity. Although both shock and kill effects seemed to be regulated by spleen tyrosine kinase, they were independent of each other, indicating that neither activation-induced cell death nor cell death-induced reactivation was occurring. Crucially, 2-HSB induced viral transcription in ART-suppressed PLWH samples in vitro. Our findings present 2-HSB as a promising dual-action compound for the \"Shock and Kill\" strategy, demonstrating efficacy in both transformed cell lines and clinically-relevant primary samples. These results raise the possibility of distinguishing the mode of action of the two effects, potentially leading to the development of a single agent causing both HIV-1 reactivation and elimination and contributing to the improvement of treatment."

    "content": "The guts of many animals are colonized by host-specific microbes, yet the extent to which host filtering shapes microbial colonization and host specificity remains poorly understood. Here, we use gnotobiotic honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a model system to systematically assess the colonization potential of a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse panel of 56 bacterial strains. This panel included native symbionts, opportunistic bee-associated taxa, gut microbes from other bee species, and non-bee environmental isolates. Bacterial load was highest for native strains and declined with increasing phylogenetic distance from native core symbionts. Competition with other bacteria reduced load across all groups, but native strains were least affected. Completeness of shared KEGG metabolic pathways correlated with load in some taxa, but metabolic capacity alone did not fully explain patterns of host filtering. A key finding was that AMP sensitivity varied widely among strains and was highest in closely related bee-associated bacteria. Notably, even highly successful colonizers such as Gilliamella and Snodgrassella were AMP-sensitive. AMP sensitivity showed a negative correlation with bacterial load, but not with the frequency of host colonization. These findings suggest that AMPs modulate symbiont abundance rather than acting as strict barriers to colonization. Overall, our results reveal that host filtering in the bee gut is multifaceted, integrating immune-mediated barriers, microbial traits, and competitive interactions."

    "content": "Botrytis pseudocinerea is a cryptic fungal species, morphologically indistinguishable from the notorious plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea, yet their distinct ecological behaviours suggest fundamental biological differences. This study resolves the paradox of why B. pseudocinerea, despite intrinsic resistance to the fungicide fenhexamid, often fails to dominate agricultural ecosystems. Remarkably, we demonstrate that B. pseudocinerea VD165 exhibits superior vegetative growth and stress tolerance compared to B. cinerea B05.10, coupled with heightened virulence on solanaceous hosts like tomato and tobacco. A comprehensive bio-guided chemical investigation combined with targeted gene expression analysis reveals a fundamental schism in its secondary metabolism. The VD165 isolate of B. pseudocinerea produces a potent phytotoxic cocktail of botcinin polyketides, a strategy supported by the constitutive and infection-induced strong upregulation of the Bcboa6 and Bcboa9 biosynthetic genes. Critically, we establish that it has completely lost the botrydial sesquiterpene pathway, a primary virulence factor in B. cinerea. The significant accumulation of the upstream terpene precursor mevalonolactone provides definitive biochemical evidence for this truncated pathway. This metabolic switch--the evolutionary loss of one major toxin gene cluster and the compensatory upregulation of another-- mirrors the co-regulatory mechanism previously demonstrated through genetic knockout of the botrydial pathway in B. cinerea and is a pivotal event that has shaped the unique pathogenic identity of B. pseudocinerea. This finding provides a model for how loss-of-function events in secondary metabolism can redefine host specificity and virulence in fungal pathogens--an evolutionary principle applicable across microbial taxa."

    "content": "Flavins are ubiquitous diffusible redox mediators that are crucial in enabling extracellular electron transfer (EET) in electroactive bacteria that often form biofilms in both natural and engineered environments. However, the behavior of flavin diffusion within biofilms remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed a colony-based electrochemical platform using interdigitated electrode arrays to quantify the diffusion coefficients of flavins within bacterial biofilms. We found that flavin diffusivity was about 11-fold enhanced in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms than in the bulk solution. However, this enhancement was abolished in the gene deletion mutant that lacked the membrane-associated flavin-binding c-type cytochrome OmcA, which suggests that the flavin-OmcA interaction on cell surfaces facilitates flavin diffusion within the biofilm. Notably, the diffusion coefficients of other redox molecules, such as methylene blue and safranin, scarcely improved in biofilms, which validates the inference that flavin-specific interaction-accelerated diffusion occurs in biofilm environments. These findings uncover a phenomenon promoting long-range electron transfer, overturning the prevailing assumption that shuttling-based EET is hindered by slow molecular diffusion in biofilms. Our study highlights the functional importance of cell-surface cytochromes in overcoming the kinetic limitation of diffusion-based electron transfer, thereby shaping the bioenergetics in biofilms."

    "content": "Muco-obstructive airway diseases result in an increase in mucus accumulation and a decrease in mucus clearance. MUC5B is the most abundant secreted mucin in the human airways, and MUC5B mucin strands dimerize to create the mucus mesh network in the healthy respiratory tract. In muco-obstructive airway diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), immune cells and bacteria release enzymes that degrade MUC5B into smaller fragments that become entangled and compacted, contributing to pathogenesis. We utilized synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum media (SCFM) to examine how mucin polymers can impact Staphylococcus aureus, a common CF pathogen that persists despite highly effective modulator therapies to correct CF disease. We found low molecular weight (LMW) mucin negatively impacts S. aureus survival and biofilm biomass compared to high molecular weight (HMW) mucin. Adding extracellular DNA to SCFM with LMW mucin was not sufficient to restore growth. LMW mucin had a broad negative impact on S. aureus laboratory strains and CF clinical isolates. We next tested other CF pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and saw no significant differences in growth in HMW or LMW mucin. LMW mucin did not significantly impact Staphylococcus epidermidis growth, indicating there may be specific interactions with S. aureus. Overall, this work highlights how interactions with pathogenic mucins may limit S. aureus growth in the diseased airways while supporting low-level persistence, and its ability to thrive in the presence of longer mucin strands may help to explain why S. aureus is well adapted to survive in the healthy respiratory tract."

In this study, we observe that the gene, arvA, is required for A. fumigatus morphogenesis, antifungal drug susceptibility, and cell wall homeostasis. Intriguingly, our study reveals novel morphological and growth aberrations in the absence of arvA. Loss of arvA results in hyper-swollen conidia that give rise to stunted, polarity-deficient hyphae in numerous environmental conditions, indicating a pivotal role for arvA in A. fumigatus morphogenesis. Surprisingly, despite these severe in vitro morphological and cell wall defects, arvA was not required for morbidity and mortality in immunologically distinct murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, growth in natural calf lung surfactant was able to normalize{Delta} arvA growth with the wild-type strain suggesting lung surfactant may partially complement the severe in vitro morphological defects of arvA loss in vivo. Taken together our observations reveal arvA as a mediator of A. fumigatus antifungal drug susceptibility and highlight the complex and ill-defined pulmonary nutrient environments role in mediating A. fumigatus pathogenesis and disease progression."

    "content": "Microbiome beta diversity analysis relies on distance-based methods including PERMANOVA combined with fixed ecological distance metrics (Bray-Curtis, Euclidean, Jaccard, and UniFrac), which treat all microbial taxa uniformly regardless of their biological relevance to community differences. This \"one-size-fits-all\" approach may miss subtle but biologically meaningful patterns in complex microbiome data. We present MeLSI (Metric Learning for Statistical Inference), a novel machine learning framework that learns data-adaptive distance metrics optimized for detecting community composition differences in multivariate microbiome analyses. MeLSI employs an ensemble of weak learners using bootstrap sampling, feature subsampling, and gradient-based optimization to learn optimal feature weights, combined with rigorous permutation testing for statistical inference. The learned metrics can be used with PERMANOVA for hypothesis testing and with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) for ordination visualization. Comprehensive validation on synthetic benchmarks and real datasets shows that MeLSI maintains proper Type I error control while delivering competitive or superior F-statistics when signal structure aligns with CLR-based weighting and, crucially, supplies interpretable feature-weight profiles that clarify which taxa drive group separation. On the Atlas1006 dataset, MeLSI achieved stronger effect sizes than the best traditional methods, and even when performance was comparable, the learned feature weights provided biological insight that fixed metrics cannot supply. MeLSI therefore offers a statistically rigorous tool that augments beta diversity analysis with transparent, data-driven interpretability."

    "content": "Mycoplasmas are genome-reduced, parasitic bacteria colonizing a broad range of organisms, including most livestock species and humans. They are often pathogenic, and have evolved an arsenal of mechanisms to counter their host's immune response. Among these, the Mycoplasma Immunoglobulin Binding/Protease (MIB-MIP) system appears to be particularly important, and is conserved in the majority of mycoplasma species. Through genomics analysis, we show that MIB-MIP systematically co-occurs with a cluster of 7 coding sequences corresponding to an atypical Type 3 F-ATPase termed \"F1-like X0\". Working in the model organism Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, we first performed a proteomics analysis to confirm that this ATPase is indeed expressed. We then generated two mutant strains in which the putative ATPase was either fully deleted, or rendered catalytically inactive through replacement of a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif of the ATPase {beta}-like subunit. Functional assays in presence of immune serum showed that both mutants are unable to protect themselves from agglutination by immunoglobulins despite the MIB-MIP system still being present. We then attempted to affinity-purify the atypical F1-like X0 ATPase from the membrane of its native host. Although the complex appears to be labile, under cross-linking conditions we were able to co-purify all its predicted components, as well as both MIB and MIP. These results allow us to attribute a function to Type 3 F-ATPase, namely to participate in the evasion from the humoral immune response in mycoplasmas, in conjunction with the MIB-MIP system through a currently unknown mechanism."

BTV replication involves RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, with RNA-binding proteins, VP6 and NS2 playing key roles in genome assembly and RNA packaging. To explore the dynamics of RNA segment interactions and the roles of VP6 and NS2 in RNA complex formation, we used RNA fluorescence in-situ Hybridisation Chain Reaction (HCR), along with site-specific mutagenesis and reverse genetics. We found that RNA segments interact sequentially, from the smallest (S10) to the largest (S1), forming a single complex that includes the entire genome. This process is independent of VP6 or NS2, although NS2 enhances the assembly of larger segments. Additionally, we show that VP6 binds to +ssRNAs before their incorporation into viral assembly factory (inclusion bodies/VIBs). These findings reveal that RNA-RNA interactions, rather than primary replicase proteins, govern the sorting and recruitment of genome segments. Our data offer new insights into BTV RNA packaging, showing that genome segments destined for packaging and dsRNA synthesis are segregated through complex formation, distinct from +ssRNAs used in protein synthesis, including those encoding the replicase complex."

    "content": "Chronic infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis are characterized by persistent inflammation and oxidative stress, yet the mechanisms enabling bacterial persistence are not fully understood. Here, we identify a novel persistence mechanism mediated by pyruvate secretion resulting from mutations in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, with analogous mutations also identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These mutations lead to elevated extracellular pyruvate which helps the establishment a more tolerogenic infection microenvironment and favor bacterial persistence. Pyruvate exerts multiple roles: scavenges reactive oxygen species such as H2O2, suppresses host immune activation both in airway epithelial cells and macrophages, and increases bacterial survival during phagocytosis. This metabolic crosstalk promotes bacterial persistence while limiting host tissue damage, aligning with the concept of disease tolerance. Our findings reveal pyruvate as a bacterial immunometabolite that mimics host antioxidant defenses, reshaping the infection niche to favor long-term colonization. This work highlights the broader role of secreted metabolites in host-pathogen interactions and suggests new strategies targeting metabolic pathways to manage chronic infections."

Interactions among constituent species may modify the growth of community members in the presence of antibiotics, for example via degradation of the antibiotic or induction of specific resistance mechanisms. However, for most polymicrobial infections the nature of such interactions is opaque, while they may affect both treatment efficacy and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here, we describe that past interaction of enterococci with Pseudomonas aeruginosa creates legacy effects that substantially alter their antibiotic tolerance and resistance evolution. Specifically, we find that the temporary exposure to pyocyanin, a secondary metabolite produced by P. aeruginosa, increases the efflux in enterococci. These tolerance legacy effects promote the evolution of antibiotic resistance of enterococci. This work shows that transient interactions in polymicrobial communities can alter the evolutionary fate of community members."

Here, we have investigated how the number and integrity of prophages present in the P. aeruginosa reflects these adaptations. We analyzed genomic sequences from 139 environmental and 145 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. We find that clinical genomes are smaller (6.5{+/-}0.29 Mbp) than environmental genomes (6.7{+/-}0.29 Mbp, p = 0.002), and exhibit higher GC content (66.25{+/-}0.2% vs. 65.32{+/-}0.3%). Genome size is inversely correlated with GC content, with clinical isolates having both smaller genome size and increased GC content. Much of the genome size difference is attributable to mobile genetic elements. Environmental isolates had more and longer intact prophages (12.33 in comparison to a clinical average of 11.5, though this finding was not statistically significant (Welch's t-test p=0.31)), and accumulated many fragmented prophage remnants. These do not appear to be lineage-associated effects - phylogenetic analyses support that both transitions from clinical to environmental and environmental to clinical occur. Our findings suggest that reduced genome size and loss of intact prophages are hallmark of the specialization of P. aeruginosa to the human body."

Here, we leveraged a large collection of C. auris isolates from multi-facility clinical outbreaks within the same urban area to identify genomic patho-adaptations that promote persistence and dissemination in the healthcare environment. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed loss-of-function mutations in the uncharacterized C. auris transcription factor gene RBA1 to have independently emerged multiple times within these outbreaks. We provide evidence that loss of RBA1 results in increased C. auris adhesion to plastic and human keratinocytes, enhances biofilm formation in multiple conditions, and exacerbates fungal burden in a mouse model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Finally, we uncover that loss-of-function mutations in RBA1 have independently emerged during multiple outbreaks of C. auris infections across the globe, and that RBA1 mutant lineages are present among isolates collected from large ongoing clinical outbreaks. Taken together, the results of this study reveal loss-of-function mutations in the C. auris RBA1 as a novel and clinically relevant genetic determinant of enhanced outbreak characteristics and virulence factor-gene expression."

    "content": "Arthropod-borne viruses, also known as arboviruses, cause disease worldwide. These viruses alternate between vertebrates and arthropods, facing distinct selection pressures in each host type. Surprisingly, whether specific mechanisms facilitate host alternation remains unclear. Here, we use bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model to investigate two phenomena potentially facilitating host alternation: adaptive mutations and genome formula variation (GFV). First, we searched for mutations indicative of host adaptation in cattle, sheep, and midges infected during an epizooty. We found a limited number of parallel mutations. This result suggests that adaptive mutations are not a main mechanism facilitating host alternation in BTV. Second, we investigated a link of GFV with a proxy of viral fitness, the speed of virus dissemination in midges. We analyzed the genome formula (GF) in experimentally-infected Culicoides imicola midges, either with an infection disseminated into the head or not. GFs differed between dissemination levels, suggesting a link between GF and the speed of virus dissemination.  Finally, we investigated the mechanisms underlying GF generation. Currently, two scenarios have been proposed: random generation followed by selection, or directed generation through molecular mechanisms. To limit the influence of selection, we analyzed the GF after a single replication cycle in cell culture. GF values converged towards specific values among replicates. Moreover, GFs differed between arthropod and vertebrate cells. Thus, GF generation is not purely stochastic and is probably influenced by host-specific mechanisms. Overall, our findings highlight GFV as a potential mechanism facilitating BTV alternation across hosts, but not classical mutation-driven evolution."

Unlike most of the fungal kingdom, this species exhibits a growth optimum at 45{degrees}C and is intolerant of temperatures below 30{degrees}C. To dissect the mechanisms of thermophilicity in this system, we implemented a large-scale insertional mutagenesis approach. We first made thousands of T. thermophilus mutants and cultured them at different temperature extremes in standard medium. Phenotyping-by-sequencing identified dozens of disrupted loci that represented candidate determinants of thermophilicity, including several annotated in metal transport. We then validated a subset of screen hits with a directed, single-gene knockout paradigm. The results revealed a temperature-dependent regulatory logic for germination, the decision point by which a fungal spore initiates growth in replete conditions. Surprisingly, most of our T. thermophilus mutants germinated far better at 50{degrees}C than the wild-type in standard medium and showed markedly slower germination at lower temperatures. We hypothesized that T. thermophilus has evolved sophisticated regulatory machinery to block germination at high temperature unless conditions are suitable. As a proof of concept, we surveyed media conditions and established that elevated zinc dampened germination of wild-type T. thermophilus at 50{degrees}C but promoted it at lower temperature. We interpret these results under a model in which T. thermophilus integrates information about temperature and nutrients before it commits to exiting the spore stage to start vegetative growth."

We tested several common bacterial cryoprotection agents like glycerol, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) over an ultra-low freeze-thaw cycle to determine an adequate method of cryoprotection for assorted bacteria. We observed different recovery rates across bacterial species and cryopreservation methods, and identified cryoprotectants that reliably resulted in viable bacteria for each of the strains tested. We present this as a resource for those working with other fastidious and host-associated bacteria that may be missing effective cryopreservation methods."

    "content": "Pyroptosis is an inflammatory cell death pathway that is a key defense mechanism of intestinal epithelial cells. To successfully establish an infection, intracytosolic Gram-negative pathogens must block this host response. Indeed, Shigella OspC3 suppresses epithelial pyroptosis by targeting and inactivating Caspase-4 (CASP4). Here, we demonstrate that OspC2, which shares 96% identity with OspC3, targets Caspase-5 (CASP5), a close paralog of CASP4. Through a combination of yeast two-hybrid, transfection, and bacterial infection assays, we show that the distinct pyroptotic caspase specificities of OspC2 and OspC3 are determined by a short -helical region, designated the Pyroptotic Caspase Specificity (PCS) domain. This domain is located upstream from the Ankyrin Rich Repeat (ARR) region previously established to promote OspC3 binding to CASP4. Swapping PCS domains between OspC2 and OspC3 is sufficient to redirect their caspase targeting. Evidence for CASP5-driven pyroptosis in response to infection has not yet been established. However, CASP5 displays signatures of positive selection at residues predicted to interact with the PCS domain of OspC2. Notably, the introduction of orangutan-specific residues into human CASP5 disrupt its interaction with and modification by OspC2, demonstrating that CASP5 natural variation can cause key functional differences in this host-microbe molecular interaction. These findings highlight the evolutionary interplay between bacterial effectors and host proteins, support a likely role for CASP5 in responding to Gram-negative bacteria, and identify promising therapeutic targets for enhancing epithelial defense against bacterial pathogens."

    "content": "The pace of change in ecological communities is central to classic and emerging problems in paleobiology and ecology. Yet measuring rates of change in community composition is problematic: traditional ecological rates (ecological distance divided by time) appear faster when measured over shorter time intervals, preventing straightforward interpretation of rates when time-scales vary. Similar problems arise when richness or sample size varies. We develop an approach that mitigates these issues using Hubbell's neutral theory, a model in which species abundances change through stochastic births and deaths in a community with a fixed number of individuals J. Change in community composition is faster for smaller J, so 1/J provides a process-based rate metric that can be estimated from empirical time-series. We derive the likelihood for changes in community composition under neutral theory. Our approach accurately estimates rates in simulated data even when time-scale, richness, and sample size vary. We use Quaternary pollen cores to demonstrate the power of this method for comparing rates between sites and across time and testing for rate shifts. Our approach can be flexibly adapted to test hypotheses on the causes of ecological change, including tests of coordinated stasis, neutral theory, and the timing of anthropogenic change."

Despite recent research efforts focussing on temporal community changes as a result of human impacts, little is known about such changes over periods exceeding a century. Here, we reconstructed long-term community changes and non-indigenous species (NIS) dynamics by using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding and geochemical analysis of sediment cores samples collected from a temperate estuary (Southampton Water, southern British Isles) subject to significant human impacts for centuries. We detected 73 species of Metazoa and Plantae and classified them by their status (native, cryptogenic and NIS). Our results revealed sporadic detection of NIS (both failed and continuously successful NIS introductions) throughout the entire sedimentary record. Notably, some NIS were detected as early as the 18th century, indicating the presence of NIS introductions in pre-industrial times. We found a continuous overall decline in native species richness since the 19th century. In addition, we found distinct peaks in copper and zinc concentrations reflecting recent periods of intensified industrial and port activity, highlighting the role of human activities in shaping biodiversity patterns and NIS dynamics. Our findings demonstrate how metabarcoding of sedaDNA archives can reveal trends in the distribution of NIS and wider biodiversity over centuries. The integrated approach used here provides new insights into biodiversity changes through time, unravels key information for biodiversity conservation management and biosecurity policy, and shows the potential that sedaDNA metabarcoding has for investigating intrinsic attributes of NIS introductions."

    "content": "Understanding the conditions that favor the persistence of metapopulations inhabiting riverine landscapes is a critical challenge in guiding conservation and restoration efforts aimed at preserving the biodiversity and ecological integrity of freshwater environments. In this work, we propose a modeling framework to investigate the transient persistence of fluvial metapopulations, i.e., the temporary occupation of riverscape patches by a metapopulation that is expected to go extinct in the long run. The theoretical foundation of our approach is rooted in the concept of ecological reactivity, which provides an effective complement to asymptotic stability analysis for studying the short-term response of ecological systems to impulsive perturbations to otherwise stable equilibria. Our results indicate that, under ecohydrological conditions conducive to a reactive metapopulation extinction equilibrium, even a metapopulation that is asymptotically bound to extinction can colonize parts of the riverscape for non-negligible periods of time. We find that the temporal scales associated with these transient phenomena, in the presence of repeated positive perturbations of the extinction equilibirum, may allow for reactive pseudo-persistence, i.e., an arbitrarily long delay in the eventual extinction of the metapopulation that may occur well below the deterministic extinction threshold. By identifying the ecohydrological drivers of reactivity-driven metapopulation persistence, as well as the riverscape patches that contribute the most to transient metapopulation dynamics over different temporal scales, our analysis may provide valuable suggestions for spatial prioritization of conservation and restoration efforts."

Location Great Britain. Time period Present (1981-2020) Major taxa studied Terrestrial invertebrates (n=1,722 species). Methods We determined the habitat associations for each of 1,722 species from 14 taxonomic groups in each of 18 land cover types in Great Britain. We used these values to calculate a human association index (based on whether species occupy human-modified land cover types, such as urban, suburban and coniferous plantation habitats, or occur in relatively unmodified land covers, such as several coastal habitats and marshlands) and habitat specialisation index (whether they are restricted to a few land cover types, or widely distributed across different land cover types) for each species. We then investigated the relationship between human association and habitat specialisation, as well as the relationship between human association and two metrics of range change between 1981-2000 and 2001-2020. Results Contrary to previous hypotheses, we find no evidence that species associated with human-modified environments are more likely to be habitat generalists. Furthermore, human-associated species were more likely to increase. On average, the geographic distributions of the most human-associated third of species increased by 58% over the study period, whereas the least human associated third of species declined by 7.1%. Main conclusions Humans have had increasingly large impacts on the world's ecosystems, generating an intensity gradient of human-modification, including novel (anthropogenic) environments. Our findings show that new environments have provided opportunities for species to colonise, generating faunas which include species that have become human-associated specialists. The ongoing expansions of species in ecosystems with relatively high levels of human modification are key components of the future of biodiversity in the Anthropocene."

    "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often carried asymptomatically in the human gut microbiota, yet the role of this carriage in AMR persistence and transmission remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed a cross-scale model that links within-host microbiota dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-ESBL-producing bacteria with transmission across hospital and community settings. The model incorporates plasmid exchange, antibiotic effects, and host heterogeneity. It integrates diverse data sources, including microbiota dynamics, community antibiotic consumption, and detailed surveillance data from a large university hospital, complemented by literature estimates. This model identifies mechanisms that enable coexistence of resistant and sensitive strains at both individual and population levels, revealing host heterogeneity as a critical driver of resistance persistence. Unlike classic epidemiological models, our analysis finds a continuum of colonization states within individuals rather than discrete resistant or sensitive categories, and highlights that realistic detection thresholds may substantially underestimate resistance prevalence. Finally, we use this framework to evaluate interventions such as hospital screening and isolation, showing that their impact strongly depends on local transmission dynamics and resistance prevalence. By bridging within-host and population processes, our model provides a novel tool for investigating AMR spread and optimizing prevention strategies in healthcare and community environments."

    "content": "Abstract\nSilicon isotopes within silicic acid, \u03b430Si, were measured on US GEOTRACES section GP15 from Alaska to Tahiti along 152\u00b0W. The distribution of silicic acid, Si(OH)4, exhibited a double Si(OH)4 maximum dominated by a midwater maximum that extended from 55\u00b0N latitude to the equator together with a bottom maximum north of 40\u00b0N latitude. The midwater maximum is dominated by North Pacific Deep Water and is consistent with the existence of a poorly ventilated North Pacific Shadow Zone between 1,500 and 3,000\u00a0m with an ideal mean age in excess of 1,300\u00a0years where regenerated Si(OH)4 accumulates. A data\u2010constrained model of the marine silicon cycle is used to assess the contribution of the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and central latitudes to the preformed and regenerated forms of both Si(OH)4 and \u03b430Si along GP15. Regenerated Si(OH)4 from the North Pacific and Southern Ocean are the dominant inputs to the midwater maximum. Silicic acid within the midwater maximum becomes lighter toward the north with a \u03b430Si minimum at about 50\u00b0N. The model indicates that this feature is shaped by ready access to successive fractionations in the productive high\u2010latitude oceans of both hemispheres. Silicon trapping within the North Pacific accounts for the upper part the \u03b430Si minimum, while the Shadow Zone's interhemispheric connectivity with the Southern Ocean accounts for the deeper part. Isotope values in the bottom Si(OH)4 maximum are slightly elevated relative to adjacent waters consistent with a sediment source, although this isotopic constraint lies within statistical uncertainty."

    "content": "Abstract\nCrown\u2010group eukaryotes diversified rapidly in the late Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga), but their evolution was slowed in the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.0\u20130.8\u00a0Ga), with a significant episode of diversification occurring again around 0.8\u00a0Ga. Previous studies suggest nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) scarcity in the seawater may have delayed eukaryotic evolution during this period. However, the influence of marine redox conditions on the evolution, either directly or indirectly, remains unclear. Applying integrated approaches of sedimentology, mineralogy and geochemistry, we analyze the shallow marine carbonates from the Zhaowei, Niyuan, and Jiudingshan formations of the Huaibei Group (ca. 1.0\u20130.95\u00a0Ga) in the southeastern North China to constrain the redox conditions of the early Neoproterozoic seawater. Microscopic observations revealed abundant water\u2010column carbonate mud (\u201cwhiting\u201d) precipitates in these formations, indicating moderately oxygenated surface waters. Geochemical results show that the I/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Mg) values of the carbonates are mostly (98%) below the Precambrian background baseline (0.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/mol), without significant negative Ce anomaly (0.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, n\u00a0=\u00a044). These findings support low\u2010oxygen conditions in the shallow waters. The combination of low oxygen conditions and nutrient scarcity likely delayed the Neoproterozoic diversification of early crown\u2010group eukaryotes. This study provides valuable insights into marine redox conditions in Earth's middle age and their potential impact on early eukaryotic evolution."

Using idealized ice shelf/ocean simulations that, for the first time, couple sediment transport with evolving bathymetry, we show that subglacial discharge increases melt rates by \u223c ${\\sim} $88%, but suspended sediment within the cavity suppresses them by \u223c ${\\sim} $1.9% in the cavity but by as much as \u223c ${\\sim} $10% near the grounding line. Sediment increases seawater bulk density, slowing buoyant fluxes, and cavity circulation, while deposition forms a seabed high at the grounding line that reduces melt there by limiting relatively warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions from reaching the ice base. Depositional events in the grounding zone may contribute to grounding zone\u00a0wedge (GZW) formation and the potential development of pinning\u2010points and grounding line advance that can impact ice sheet stability.

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe temporal sequence and mechanistic interplay between life\u2010history and mating\u2010system transitions in plants remain poorly understood. Here, we combine crossing experiments with population genomic analyses to investigate these processes in the Incarvillea sinensis complex (Bignoniaceae), which contains annual selfing and perennial outcrossing populations. Crossing experiments revealed complete post\u2010zygotic isolation between annuals and perennials. Genomic data derived from de novo assemblies of annual and perennial individuals, along with SNP and chloroplast sequencing of 126 individuals from 30 populations, demonstrated strong genetic divergence between life histories, with no evidence of contemporary gene flow between them. Compared to perennials, annuals exhibited significantly reduced genetic diversity, elevated differentiation and a greater number of chromosomal rearrangements\u2014particularly translocations. Divergence time estimates indicated that annual and perennial lineages split during the early Pleistocene (ca. 2.22 Mya), whereas the shift to selfing from outcrossing within the annual lineage was a more recent event, occurring during the late Pleistocene (~0.03 Mya). These results indicate that the mating\u2010system shift was not the initial driver of divergence, and we infer that the life\u2010history transition likely occurred earlier, although its precise timing could not be directly determined. Our findings support a two\u2010stage model of divergence in which adaptation to seasonally arid environments first drove the evolution of annuality, initiating speciation through ecological isolation and genetic divergence. The subsequent evolution of selfing then likely further promoted reproductive isolation via both pre\u2010 and post\u2010zygotic mechanisms, potentially accelerating rapid genomic differentiation and effectively completing the speciation process."

    "content": "Abstract\nGeothermal reservoirs commonly record seismic and creep events, constituting earthquake hazards in enhanced geothermal systems. To understand the geological controls on mixed\u2010mode frictional behaviors in these settings, we performed friction experiments on fault gouges from the polyphase\u2010altered carbonate Massenkalk Formation in Germany, a regional priority target for geothermal energy production. The experiments, performed at conditions consistent with \u223c4\u00a0km deep geothermal reservoir, yield evolved friction coefficients of \u223c0.48 for limestone and \u223c0.61 for dolostone, whereas the silicate\u2010carbonate fault gouges exhibit \u223c0.55. Dolostone gouges exhibit unstable sliding at low displacement rates, whereas the limestone and silicate\u2010carbonate gouges are stable at all investigated conditions, with the dolostone and silicate\u2010carbonate samples exhibiting the most significant microstructural strain localization. These results suggest that the geochemical alteration history of geothermal systems may facilitate hybrid frictional behaviors of seismic and aseismic slip within the same reservoir, and that cataclastic strain localization style is independent of frictional behavior."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM), a dominant air\u2010sea coupling mode in the subtropical southeastern Pacific, serves as a precursor to equatorial Pacific variability. Its seasonality, however, shows an out\u2010of\u2010phase relation between sea surface temperature (SST) (peaking in December\u2013February, DJF) and wind (peaking in June\u2013August, JJA) indices that remain unclear. Through a mixed\u2010layer heat budget analysis, we reveal that thermodynamical wind\u2010evaporation\u2010SST feedback dominates SPMM\u2010SST growth, with its efficiency controlled by the seasonal cycle of mixed\u2010layer depth, dominating SPMM seasonality. Dynamical processes suppress SPMM\u2010SST anomalies, with meridional advection acting as the dominant damping mechanism in both JJA and DJF, and being particularly strong in JJA. Stronger meridional advection damping in JJA enlarges the DJF peak of SPMM\u2010SST, indicating a role beyond thermodynamics. Further investigation reveals that the meridional advection arises largely from wind stress\u2010driven Ekman transport. These findings highlight the importance of meridional advection process in shaping SPMM seasonality, offering insights for improving SPMM\u2010related climate predictability."

    "content": "Abstract\nUsing aircraft observations and a cloud model with particle\u2010based microphysics, it is shown that the enhancement of drop collision\u2010coalescence from turbulence in clouds not only leads to earlier onset of rain in warm cumulus clouds as past studies have suggested, but also significantly dampens the precipitation susceptibility to aerosol loading. Enhanced drop coalescence from turbulence substantially increases the production of drizzle embryos just above cloud base, which in turn act as seeds that accelerate rain drop growth at mid and upper cloud levels even in highly polluted conditions. In contrast, pollution aerosols strongly inhibit rainfall when the commonly assumed gravitational\u2010only collision kernel is used and turbulent coalescence is neglected. Overall, turbulence\u2010enhanced drop coalescence strongly influences the response of warm cumulus clouds and precipitation to aerosol loading, suggesting that the effects of turbulent coalescence should be included in Earth system model representations of aerosol\u2010cloud\u2010precipitation interactions and aerosol indirect radiative forcing."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe global characteristics of gravity wave potential energy variation depending on local time are analyzed using satellite observations covering a broad range of local times. A clear diurnal variation is observed in the equatorial region between 15\u00b0S and 15\u00b0N. At midlatitudes (15\u00b0N\u201360\u00b0N and 15\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0S), a semidiurnal variation is observed at higher altitudes above 90\u00a0km, in addition to the diurnal variation at lower altitudes below 90\u00a0km. These results are consistent with previous studies of ground\u2010based observations, though quantitative comparisons are difficult. The potential energy variation corresponds to the variation in static stability, which is also obtained from the same satellite observations. The local time variation of temperature is consistent with the variation in static stability, while the zonal wind variation is not always consistent. These results suggest the importance of temperature structures associated with tides, in the interaction between gravity waves and tides."

Here we analyze the strong motion data recorded at a near\u2010fault station during the 2025 Mw 7.8 Myanmar earthquake to estimate the detailed source process around that station. By comparing simulated velocity waveforms under various conditions with the observed one, we find that a supershear rupture with speed surpassing 2 $\\sqrt{2}$ times S\u2010wave speed is required to fit the first\u2010order features of the observation. Moreover, a fault barrier at \u223c6\u00a0km south of the station is inferred by the reversed\u2010polarity fault\u2010parallel secondary pulse following the main pulse, interpreted as a stopping phase. Together with other information, the results suggest an overall fast yet intermittent rupture process during the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, with the inferred barrier likely representing a segmentation boundary for the Sagaing fault."

Using four ocean reanalysis products, we identify a significant interannual see\u2010saw variability in subduction rates of the South Pacific western and eastern Subtropical Mode Water (SPWSTMW and SPESTMW), which is primarily driven by changes in the mixed layer depth (MLD). Composite analysis demonstrates that the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation induced winds are largely responsible for variations in latent heat flux, which alter MLD and modulate the subduction rates. In addition, a west\u2010strong/east\u2010weak subduction rate pattern in 1963\u20131978 and a west\u2010weak/east\u2010strong subduction rate pattern in 1998\u20132011 are observed.

Combining a mechanical discrete element model and a hydraulic finite element model, three normal stress\u2010related hydro\u2010mechanical regimes can be identified. Under low normal stress conditions (<4.0\u00a0MPa), permeability is enhanced during shearing due to dilation on intact asperities. With increasing normal stress, asperities break and gouge is formed, leading to a normal stress\u2010related transition where permeability tends to decrease during shearing. In our study, this transition occurs when normal stress equals the rock's ultimate tensile strength (4.0\u00a0MPa). For normal stresses >4.0\u00a0MPa, permeability decreases during shearing due to intense fracture surface damage."

    "content": "Restriction-modification (R-M) systems are one of the most widespread and, due to their often plasmid-based nature, transmittable anti-phage systems bacteria have. The CfrBI R-M system studied here consists of a methyltransferase (MT) and a restriction endonuclease (RE) that are divergently expressed and share a promoter region that harbors a single CfrBI recognition site. Previously, the methylation of this site has been shown to regulate the expression of the R-M system. Here, we show that the expression dynamics of the CfrBI R-M system and its protective properties depend on the copy number of the plasmid harboring it. A higher copy number results in higher expression, but the expression on a medium-copy number plasmid interestingly conferred the highest phage resistance. After transformation of naive cells however, expression of the RE was fastest in the high-copy plasmid background. In vivo we show that the expression strength of the MT inhibits its own expression, while enhancing RE expression. To conclude, the results indicate that for phage resistance the overall expression strength might not be the predominant factor in case of the CfrBI R-M system, while for the establishment of the system the initial expression rate of the MT seems to be the determining factor."

Extensive inter-subunit interactions and additional phospholipids generate the higher rigidity of the rod. The LP ring utilizes more electrostatic charges on the inner surface and less physical contacts to facility the higher-speed rotation of the rod. The additional HT ring tightly binds to the outer surface of the LP ring to enhance the LP-ring stability. A previously function-unknown component FlrP enhances the interactions of 15 FliF peptides of the MS ring with the rod and stabilizes the LPHT and MS rings. The hook has two different states, L- and R-state, which provides structural flexibility of the hook to drive the unique forward-reverse-flick motility of the bacteria in the flicking process. This study provides unprecedented molecular insights into evolution and structural adaptions of the bacterial polar flagellar motors for high-torque transmission."

    "content": "Phages Girr and NormanBulbieJr (NBJ) infect Gram-positive Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155. Both phages contain conserved lysis cassettes that harbor two endolysin genes (lysin A and lysin B ) and two genes encoding transmembrane domain (TMD) holin-like proteins. The first holin-like protein, termed LysF1a is 88 amino acids, has two TMDs and a predicted N-in-C-in membrane topology. The second, termed LysF1b, has a single N-terminal TMD and a predicted N-out-C-in topology making it distinct from the 1TMD type III holins or spanins in size and membrane topology. Deletion of either lysF1a or lysF1b results in lysis defect phenotypes manifest by reduced plaque size and changes to lysis timing in liquid culture. Deletion of both lysF1a and lysF1b genes is lethal to phage propagation supporting holin function. Phages expressing only the LysF1b protein trigger lysis prematurely when exposed to energy poisons while phages expressing only LysF1a do not show early triggering. Lysis recovery mutants were isolated from phages lacking the lysF1b gene and these mutants generated wild type plaque size but triggered lysis prematurely and showed ~65% reductions in burst size. Genome sequencing identified different point mutations that mapped to TMD1 or the C-terminal region of the lysF1a gene. Finally, infection of an M. smegmatis strain that does not produce lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan by either wild type phages or phages carrying the lysF1b deletion showed modest plaque size increases and did not fully complement the lysis defect of phages lacking the lysF1b gene. Collectively, the findings show that both LysF1a and LysF1b function as holins and are required for efficient bacterial lysis. LysF1a does not function as an antiholin but requires the expression of the LysF1b protein for efficient lysis functioning. The requirement of two holins with distinct membrane topologies for host lysis has not been described previously."

    "content": "Chemosynthetic symbioses between animals and bacteria are known to underpin productivity in the deep sea, yet the diversity of energy and carbon sources sustaining these associations in shallow-water environments remains poorly understood. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is highly abundant in coastal habitats, where it is produced by seagrasses, phytoplankton, and heterotrophic bacteria, and occurs together with its breakdown product dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in shallow-water sediments. Here we show, supported by genomic and transcriptomic evidence, that DMSP and DMS cycling are integral to the energy and carbon metabolism of the gutless oligochaete Olavius algarvensis and its chemosynthetic symbionts. By assigning DMSP degradation pathways to individual members of the host's microbial community, we reconstructed a network integrating demethylation and cleavage with energy conservation, methionine biosynthesis, and acetate assimilation into polyhydroxyalkanoates. We also identified a host-encoded methanethiol oxidase (MtoX) suggesting host participation in MeSH detoxification. Comparative metagenomic analyses of more than 60 gutless oligochaete species from globally distributed habitats showed that key DMSP- and DMS-processing genes (dddP, dmdA, tmm, dmsA) are widespread, indicating that organosulfur metabolism is a conserved feature of these symbioses. Our findings expand the recognized metabolic repertoire of shallow-water chemosynthetic symbioses and provide evidence that these associations directly contribute to marine DMSP and DMS cycling."

In the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, CDPK3 is essential for the sexual stage development of the parasite within mosquitoes. However, the function of CDPK3 in the most lethal human malaria parasite, P. falciparum remains unexplored. Moreover, the calcium dependent kinase activity of CDPK3 has not been experimentally tested. With the aim to biochemically characterize CDPK3 and perform its functional evaluation in the asexual replication of P. falciparum, here we have expressed the full-length CDPK3 in E. coli and demonstrated that it is a bona fide calcium dependent kinase using a luminescence-based assay and a semi-synthetic epitope approach. Complete knock-out of cdpk3 using CRISPR/Cas9 did not show any defect in the asexual replication of the parasite and the knockout parasites look morphologically similar to the wild type. Our study suggests that cdpk3 is not essential for the asexual replication of the parasite under in vitro culture conditions. Perhaps CDPK3 is required for the sexual development of P. falciparum like its ortholog in the rodent malaria parasite. CDPK3 may be a good target for the development of transmission blocking drugs."

The importance of PknF for the virulence of Mtb in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the Mtb CDC1551 deletion mutant of pknF ({Delta}pknF) expresses significantly increased levels of the lipid pthiocerol dimycoserosate (PDIM), a polyketide lipid with pro-virulence properties. The {Delta}pknF mutant strain, when compared to the Mtb and complemented strains, had a 100-fold increase in growth at day 28 and about a 10-fold increase in growth at days 90-98 in the lungs of mice. The increase in pulmonary bacterial loads after infection with {Delta}pknF strain was conserved even in Nlrp3-deficient mice, arguing that PknF modulates Mtb virulence independently of NLRP3-inflammasome activation in mice. Staining of lung sections revealed increased inflammation in the lungs of {Delta}pknF strain-infected mice when compared to Mtb and the complemented mutant strain. Highly susceptible B6.Sst1S mice displayed decreased host resistance with significantly decreased survival when infected with the {Delta}pknF strain compared to the complemented strain or Mtb. In conclusion, our data suggest that expression of PknF, as a modulator of multiple downstream effector proteins, restricts the virulence of Mtb in the lungs of mice through an NLRP3 inflammasome-independent mechanism but potentially via suppressing expression of the virulence lipid, PDIM."

    "content": "Urban ecosystems provide essential ecosystem services (ES), a supply that is dependent on ecosystem condition (EC). Statistical frameworks like the UN SEEA-EA explicitly link ES flows to the extent and condition of ecosystem assets. Yet, the concrete role of EC in shaping ES supply remains only partially understood, as their relationship is complex and varies across services. Consequently, the operational integration of EC into urban ES assessments remains fragmented. Through a systematic review of 110 studies (2005-2024), we evaluated how and to what extent EC has been incorporated into urban ES assessments. For each study, we examined ES assessment methods, types of condition variables, spatial and temporal explicitness, flow types (potential vs. actual), and sustainability considerations. We find that integration is decisively underway, with most studies (87%) using EC variables as inputs, predominantly for regulating services. However, this integration is narrow: it relies on static methods, focuses on potential over actual flows, and favors easily measurable abiotic and structural state variables over functional, compositional, or landscape ones. While spatial explicitness is common (45%), dynamic models are rare (20%), and assessments seldom leverage EC to evaluate ES flow sustainability. Addressing these gaps, by broadening types of EC variables, increasing temporal dynamism, and linking condition to both actual flows and sustainability, will enhance the capacity of urban ES assessments to support the planning and adaptive management of urban greening. It will also help advance the development of urban ecosystem condition and service accounts, thereby increasing the relevance of urban ES assessment knowledge."

Recent evidence suggests that climate- and human-induced perturbations can destabilize gas hydrates and trigger methane release2-5, yet the response of deep-sea ecosystems to these changes remains poorly understood. Here we show multi-year in situ monitoring of seabed ecosystem following methane leakage induced by hydrate exploration activities. Within just two years, benthic microbial and eukaryotic diversity in the affected areas declined significantly, while microbial and macrofaunal abundance increased. Integrated geochemical and omics analyses reveal the rapid successional shift of seabed ecosystem to a novel chemosynthetic system. Aerobic methanotrophs (Methyloprofundus) co-established with unexpectedly fast growing anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-3), accompanied by a rapid recruitment of opportunistic polychaetes that bioirrigated the seabed to >50 cm depths. The active animal-microbe interactions sustained exceptionally high rates of methane oxidation that utilized diverse electron acceptors. We demonstrate that methane hydrate destabilization can trigger rapid collapse of native seabed ecosystem while driving the formation of an effective \"methane biofilter\" consuming this potent greenhouse gas much faster than previously estimated. Understanding seabed ecosystem response and feedback is critical for predicting benthic methane cycling under ongoing global change and for developing sustainable strategies for methane hydrate resource management."

However, PyOM can be combusted or chemically altered in subsequent fires. To explore the effect of subsequent fire on PyOM, we used a mass loss calorimeter to deliver realistic heat fluxes to jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) PyOM produced at 350 {degrees}C, testing heat flux profiles (High, Low, and Control) and burial depths (Surface, 1 cm, and 5 cm) in a full-factorial design. We found that both variables significantly affected the C remaining after burns (p < 0.05), with greater C losses at higher heat fluxes and shallower exposure depths. Consistent with our predictions, treatments with high heat exposure (HFHigh+Surface, HFHigh+1cm, HFLow+Surface) showed increases in pH and decreases in total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and mineralized C after the subsequent fire. Counter to our predictions, treatments with intermediate heat exposure (HFHigh+5cm and HFLow+1cm) caused significant decreases in pH and increases in DOC, mineralized C, modelled decomposable C, and modelled C decomposition rate (p < 0.05), compared to the unburned controls. These findings highlight that, despite its high persistence in fire-free conditions, PyOM is readily combusted and altered in subsequent fires, with important implications for changing fire regimes and the global C cycle."

    "content": "Natural enemies are thought to promote coexistence of competing victim species. Although existing theory suggests victim coexistence increases with enemy specialization, the dynamics and potential extinction of enemies is generally discounted. Where enemy dynamics have been considered, empirically atypical linear functional responses have been studied. These limitations could over-simplify inferences about enemy-mediated coexistence. We studied the dynamics of two competing victim species and two enemy species with a deterministic model. We derived equilibrium points, and used linear stability analysis, numerical simulations and Floquet theory to determine the influence of enemy specificity and non-linear functional responses on coexistence in this victim-enemy community. We found greater specificity could drive enemy equilibrium points to infeasible values. We found only accelerating enemy functional responses result in stable equilibrium point coexistence of otherwise equivalent competitor victims, in which case greater specificity results in greater stability. Linear and saturating responses produce complex dynamics (neutral or limit cycles, chaos) or extinction, with limit cycle stability highest at intermediate specificity. Our results indicate strict specificity may not maximize coexistence, and enemy functional response critically influences whether enemies promote victim coexistence. They highlight the need to incorporate enemy dynamics into the growing body of theory regarding enemy-mediated diversity maintenance."

Additionally, it assesses the potential suitability of the region for this mosquito species. Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected as part of a comprehensive survey of Culicidae in Cochabamba city and its suburbs. Larvae of An. pseudopunctipennis were collected on April 16, 2024, and reared to the fourth instar in the laboratory. One male specimen obtained from collected larvae was pinned. Specimens were morphologically identified using a standard identification key and species re-description. The larval identification was based on its unique spiracular apparatus, while adults were identified by their characteristic black hind tarsomeres and unspotted wing costa. The specimens are preserved in the Laboratory of Medical Entomology at UMSS, Cochabamba. Results: A single larval habitat was identified in Lincoln Park, in the center of Cochabamba. It consisted of a 184-square-meter pond with a cement bottom, clear water with very slow flow from a small spring, and abundant Rhizoclonium algae. A Maxent habitat suitability model indicated that the Cochabamba Valley provides suitable environmental conditions for An. pseudopunctipennis. Conclusions: This study provides the first concrete evidence of An. pseudopunctipennis in Cochabamba city, confirming its presence after decades of speculation. However, its low abundance and limited larval habitats due to urbanization and pollution suggest that it poses no significant malaria transmission risk in the area."

Lucinidae, an ancient and species-rich family of marine bivalves, host chemosynthetic sulphur-oxidising bacteria within gill epithelial cells, and is well-known for its contribution to inorganic sulphur cycling in marine sediments worldwide. Little is known about organosulfur transformations by lucinid-associated microbiota or the host's potential contribution. Here, we integrated field measurements, genomics, transcriptomics, and experimental assays to investigate organosulfur cycling in three lucinid species from temperate and tropical environments. Concentrations of the osmolyte dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) in lucinids were typically much higher than in their surrounding environment, and varied with host species and season, but not with symbiont abundance. Indeed, candidate DMSP synthesis DSYB genes were expressed by the animal hosts implying that the host may be the source of DMSP. Furthermore, a newly identified and isolated Candidatus Endozoicomonas endolucinida symbiont was capable of DMSP catabolism to dimethylsulphide (DMS), which could be further syntrophically oxidised by the sulphur-oxidising symbionts that encode methanethiol oxidase genes in their genomes. Finally, incubation experiments supported a combined role of the host and its associated microbiome in organosulfur cycling during stress, with the highest DMSP concentrations measured when holobionts were incubated with antibiotics under anoxic conditions. This study identified a previously unrecognised microbial partner in lucinid symbioses and revealed its potential organosulphur-based metabolic interactions with both the host and the sulphur-oxidising symbionts, highlighting the capacity of these widespread associations to influence global organosulfur cycling."

    "content": "The influence of global change on species assemblage patterns is on the rise with evidence showing a steady decline in pollinator communities across the globe. As such, the implementation of rigorous monitoring efforts aimed at documenting the actual status of pollinators is of essence especially in the tropics. This can be possible through participatory studies with volunteers (citizen scientists) that emphasizes on apriori research hypotheses with the aim to draw inferences on the potential drivers of species community assemblage patterns. In ecology, photos have the ability to drive change and can provide unbiased evidence on species existence with a potential to compare changes over time and space. However, in the tropics and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, such ideas fall short of public participation. In this study, we aimed to assess and digitally document plants and their bee visitors as important data sources with immense potential to improve on the knowledge and awareness of the different plants and bee species in two counties of Kenya (Taita and Murang'a). Our results showed marked differences in bee community assemblage patterns between the two counties, with a huge number of unique species between them. We successfully digitalised and present photos of 114 bee and 262 plant species. Using these digitalised photographs, we herein elaborate on the community assemblage patterns of plants and their bee pollinators in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot (EABH) of Kenya and further discuss the importance of exploiting images for research in biodiversity and conservation. We therefore conclude that, technological advances that helps in digitalising species through photography can be important in the successful implementation of community based environmental threat management agendas."

This study synthesises long-term landing data from 1993 to 2024 with a systematic review of regional legislation to explore how management frameworks influence the resilience of fisheries. In the northwest Mediterranean, which includes Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, and Murcia, fisheries have experienced synchronous declines, a consequence of overexploitation, fragmented governance, and reactive, top-down regulation. In contrast, Andalusia, encompassing both the Atlantic and Alboran Sea coasts, has demonstrated more resilient trajectories, bolstered by greater ecological productivity and the adoption of adaptive governance strategies since the 2010s. In this region, the implementation of gear-specific management plans, rigorous scientific monitoring (including satellite tracking), and prompt administrative responses have facilitated more sustainable exploitation. Our findings highlight the necessity of aligning governance with ecological connectivity and integrating adaptive co-governance structures that engage fishers to safeguard the future of small-scale fisheries. More broadly, this research emphasises the value of coordinated superregional or national management frameworks that incorporate ecological knowledge, promote stakeholder participation, and allow for timely regulatory adaptation."

    "content": "Abiotic stresses like heat and drought pose major threats to forest ecosystems and are anticipated to increase due to anthropogenic climate change. One mechanism by which plants cope with stress conditions is tailoring their microbiomes to aid in stress tolerance. However, experimentally imposing abiotic stresses to examine impacts on tree microbiomes over long timescales is impractical. Naturally occurring climate gradients provide an opportunity to observe the longer-term effects of abiotic stress on soil and tree-associated microbiomes, potentially informing projections on how these relationships will respond to climate change. Populus trichocarpa is an ecologically important tree species, a major source of wood products, a potential bioenergy feedstock, and has emerged as a model species for both biological and ecological processes. To understand how belowground plant-microbe interactions changed across climatic gradients, we collected bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere samples from P. trichocarpa trees found along a 200 km transect over the Cascade Mountains in Washington, USA within the Cowlitz River Basin on the wetter, western side and along the Tieton River basin on the drier, eastern side. Precipitation rates and temperatures varied considerably over the ~1300-meter elevation span. We performed 16S and ITS2 amplicon sequencing to examine the bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities, as well as soil chemical and physical characteristics, stand characteristics, and host tree physiology. We hypothesized that the soil and P. trichocarpa-associated rhizosphere and root endosphere microbiomes would vary in response to the naturally occurring climate gradient along the transect. We found that for each niche sampled, bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities clustered into three distinct micro-climate groups: a wetter community common across the Cowlitz River sites, a drier community of the lower altitude Tieton River sites, and a high elevation community at the crest of the pass and along the upper Tieton River. The community differences between these micro-climate groups were diminished within the P. trichocarpa root endosphere, though still evident, indicating that while P. trichocarpa may have a selective and homogenizing effect on the microbiome, abiotic factors play a major role in the overall shaping of these microbial communities."

    "content": "The functioning of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks is crucial for ecosystem service provisioning and biodiversity maintenance. However, multiple drivers of global change are causing an alarming decline of wild pollinators' abundance and richness. We propose an ecological, process-based mathematical model describing the dynamics of pollinators and plants, properly mediated by reward resources. Our model explicitly accounts for the main interactions of both facilitative and competitive nature that occur both within and between the two guilds. We apply our model to a broad set of real communities in fragmented landscapes to investigate the mechanisms that link the architecture of the interaction networks, the pollinators' temporal persistence and abundance at the community level, and their rarity at the landscape level. Our results suggest that few generalist pollinators form a core of abundant, persistent and widely distributed species, while a lower number of mutualistic partners is generally associated with low abundance, low persistence and high turnover between patches. Specialists, however, are crucial to maintaining high levels of biodiversity within the community. This finding highlights the importance of ecological connectivity, through which local extinctions can be counter-balanced by recolonizations. Our analysis shows how a mechanistic model accounting for the structure of plant-pollinator networks can serve as a tool to investigate important ecological mechanisms driving community composition, dynamics and the resulting species distribution patterns."

It can occur, both within- and across generations, as a response to environmental information or to environmental quality affecting individual somatic state. Information- and state-based plasticity have largely been investigated independently, which limits theoretical developments and empirical result interpretation. In this study, we investigate the interaction between these two types of plasticity in the context of anti-predator defences, using a two-generation laboratory experiment in the snail Physa acuta. Our results revealed that both types of plasticity participate in shaping the within- and transgenerational responses. Within a generation, the limited resource decreases the individual`s somatic state but did not constrain the costly expression of defences. Across generations, the poor state of parents decreased the offspring state, which in turn decreased the absolute levels of their defences. The lower defences of offspring from low-resource parents were, however, compensated by a higher reproductive success. By illustrating the intimately intertwining between information- and state-based plasticity, our study calls for increased study integrating their complex interactions to improve research about the role of phenotypic plasticity in ecology and evolution."

These three forest habitats were sampled in six localities with pitfall traps and Winkler extractions. The discovered ant communities, the species typical of each habitat and the effectiveness of both sampling methods are discussed. The results showed that 190 species belonging to 50 genera and 8 sub-families of Formicidae were sampled in the Yangambi region. Ant diversity was lowest in fallow land, higher in secondary forests, and highest in primary forests, reflecting a clear pattern along the successional gradient. A relatively small proportion of ant species were shared among all three habitats, while each habitat also supported a distinct set of species. Primary forests hosted the highest number of exclusive species, followed by secondary forests and fallow land. Winkler extractors captured substantially more ant species than pitfall traps, with nearly 50% greater species richness observed. However, a significant portion of the ant fauna in Yangambi likely remains undocumented, and additional sampling methods could help provide a more complete picture of its biodiversity."

    "content": "Marsh ecosystems represent ecotones of high ecological significance where terrestrial and aquatic systems converge, governed by strong gradients in salinity and flooding. These environments sustain specialised communities and perform vital ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration or nutrient cycling. This study examined carabid beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages across freshwater and saltwater marshes along the Elbe estuary in northern Germany to assess how environmental conditions shape patterns of abundance, diversity, and functional traits. Over 17,000 individuals representing 84 species were collected between March and October 2024. Despite similar species richness between marsh types, community composition differed markedly (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity: 0.92), reflecting environmental filtering along the salinity gradient. Freshwater marshes exhibited greater overall functional richness, while saltwater marshes supported more functionally even and divergent trait distributions, indicating stronger niche specialization under saline stress. Seasonal activity was bimodal in both habitats but peaked earlier in freshwater sites. A generalized linear mixed model revealed significant positive relationships between carabid activity abundance and functional richness of both dispersal- and preference-based traits. These findings demonstrate that salinity and flooding regimes drive distinct taxonomic and functional assemblages, with trait diversity underpinning ecosystem resilience and functioning. The study establishes an ecological baseline for future monitoring of marshland biodiversity and highlights the necessity of conserving functionally diverse communities to maintain the ecological integrity of tidal and floodplain marshes under changing environmental conditions."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.04.692099v1?rss=1",
    "content": "In temperate regions, vector-borne disease risk is mediated by cold winter conditions, however, the cold tolerance of key vector taxa remains poorly understood. Culicoides biting midges are the primary vectors of several pathogens of medical and veterinary importance including bluetongue virus, where seasonal cold weather in temperate regions limits midge activity and pathogen transmission. Here, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of cold tolerance across all developmental stages of Culicoides nubeculosus, a widely used laboratory species that is endemic to northern Europe. Eggs, first-instar larvae, fourth-instar larvae, pupae, and adults were exposed to acute (1 h) and extended (6 and 24 h) cold treatments spanning -1 to -18 {degrees}C, with survival, development, emergence, and adult wing size quantified. Culicoides nubeculosus showed substantial but stage-specific cold tolerance, with survival limits of [&le;] -18 {degrees}C for eggs, -14 {degrees}C for pupae, -10 {degrees}C for L1 larvae and adults, and -7 {degrees}C for L4 larvae. While the effect of cold exposure duration varied across temperatures and life stages, extended exposure generally reduced survival at lower temperatures. Cold stress caused sublethal effects, including reduced adult emergence when eggs or larvae were exposed and reductions in adult wing size of up to ~10%, depending on the life stage. These results reveal substantial cold tolerance across the full life history of C. nubeculosus, suggesting that factors beyond temperature influence population phenology. Our findings provide new insights into Culicoides ecology, with implications for seasonal vector population dynamics and arbovirus transmission risk in temperate regions."

    "content": "Desert soil degradation, primarily caused by anthropogenic disturbance and desertification, poses significant challenges for ecosystem restoration in degraded ecosystems. Soil microbial communities, particularly diazotrophs, play a crucial role in different soil system processes, including nutrient cycling, and can improve nitrogen-limited characteristics of nutrient-poor soil systems. Free-living and root-associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria have great potential to enhance nitrogen availability in the nitrogen-limited soil and support host plant growth and nutrient acquisition. Free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and root-associated rhizobacteria contribute a substantial amount of nitrogen to ecosystems, including arid lands. This study evaluated the growth performance and nutrient uptake ability of four native plant species of Kuwait inoculated with a consortium of selected indigenous putative diazotrophs isolated from the Kuwait desert. The seedlings of Vachellia pachyceras were inoculated with both indigenous root-nodule bacteria isolated from Kuwait desert and a commercial inoculum to evaluate their symbiotic efficiency. The seedlings were cultivated under greenhouse conditions in both native desert soils and in potting mix to assess the extent to which growth medium influenced inoculation response. The primary objective was to determine whether the inoculated indigenous N2 fixing bacteria could contribute early seedling development and nutrient acquisition, thereby supporting their potential use them as biofertilizer in future large-scale restoration efforts. Bacterial inoculation significantly enhanced plant dry mass and nutrient uptake across all tested plant species compared to the non-inoculated controls. The magnitude of improvement varied with bacterial density, plant species, and growth medium used. These findings are consistent with evidence that isolated indigenous N2-fixers have the potential to enhance plant growth and nutrient uptake in selected native plant species, supporting their use as biofertilizers for restoration and revegetation efforts in arid environments. This study represents the first evaluation of Kuwaits native seedlings inoculated with indigenous diazotrophs, highlighting their potential for sustainable ecosystem restoration."

    "content": "Remote coral reef ecosystems face increasing threats from climate change and anthropogenic pressures, yet comprehensive monitoring remains logistically and financially challenging in isolated regions. This paper presents a standardized framework to bridge this data gap by mobilizing the global recreational cruising fleet as citizen scientists. We describe a low-cost, accessible methodology utilizing widely available action cameras and GPS units to capture continuous video transects without requiring specialized taxonomic training. The collected data is aggregated onto a freely accessible, open-source web platform that integrates high-resolution video with precise geospatial tracking. This system enables remote analysis by experts and machine learning algorithms, facilitating the monitoring of benthic cover, reef health, and bleaching events in areas previously inaccessible to regular scientific survey. By validating a decentralized model for data collection, this framework offers a scalable solution for global reef monitoring while fostering environmental stewardship within the maritime community."
