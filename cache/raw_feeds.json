    "content": "New insights into materials with differentiated pore structures are synthesized through precursor purification to investigate the rate\u2010performance failure mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHard carbons are considered to be the most promising anode materials for sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) because of their low cost and high sodium storage performance. However, the inadequate rate performance of hard carbon remains a critical bottleneck hindering high\u2010power applications of SIBs. Herein, we elucidate the key structural descriptors underlying the rate\u2010performance failure mechanism by constructing hard carbon with tailored microstructures, achieved via precise regulation of precursor composition. It is worth noting that the hard carbons engineered with the aforementioned differentiated structural design exhibit similar thermodynamic behaviors for sodium storage, but markedly different kinetic properties. At a current density of 2 A g\u22121, the reversible capacity of ABP\u2010L\u20101400 is 304.6 mAh g\u22121, which is 1.24 times of ABP\u2010H\u20101400. Systematic characterization reveals that the kinetic difference is primarily attributable to variations in low\u2010plateau capacity, with key influencing factors identified through in\u2010depth analysis as the uniform organic/inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase and the micro\u2010open pore structure. Additionally, practical applications can be extended to high\u2010power Prussian blue//hard carbon cylindrical cells, demonstrating a capacity of 702.2 mAh at 5 C. This work provides guidance for the design of advanced fast\u2010charging SIBs.",

The electrode achieves remarkable OER performance and durability, highlighting a practical pathway toward electronic structure\u2010engineered catalysts for large\u2010scale alkaline water electrolysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe sluggish kinetics of the multiple\u2010electron/proton oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a major bottleneck for alkaline water electrolysis. Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts is thus crucial for developing OER electrodes with superior activity and durability. Herein, we report a simple two\u2010step strategy to construct a magnetic free\u2010standing FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode, in which Fe doping effectively tailors the electronic spin structure of metal active sites, leading to remarkable OER activity. Specifically, the FeNiCoSe2/Ni3Se4 electrode delivers a low overpotential of 278 mV at 100 mA cm\u22122 and a small Tafel slope of 47.0 mV dec\u22121 in 1.0 m KOH. Remarkably, it maintains stable operation for over 900\u00a0h at 5000 A m\u22122 under high\u2010temperature and concentrated alkaline conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability and practical feasibility for industrial water electrolysis. Such superior performance originates from the high\u2010spin state of in situ formed metal (oxy)hydroxide active phase, which synergistically optimizes the adsorption\u2010desorption balance and electron transfer processes. This work offers a mechanistic investigation for regulating electronic spin structures via a doping strategy, paving the way for electronic\u2010engineered free\u2010standing electrodes toward industrial water electrolysis.",

This approach enables the first scalable 30 x 30 cm2 semi\u2010transparent solar module, highlighting its potential for building\u2010integrated and indoor photovoltaics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBalancing transparency and efficiency remains a key challenge for semi\u2010transparent perovskite solar cells (ST\u2010PSCs), restricting their application in building\u2010integrated photovoltaics and indoor electronics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy combining optical modelling, transparent electrode engineering, and molecular passivation to overcome this transparency\u2010efficiency trade\u2010off. Guided by transfer matrix simulations, a 1.7 eV FAMA\u2010based perovskite layer with a thickness of \u223c185 nm was integrated with an optimized MoO3/Au/MoO3 top electrode (59.9% transmittance).

Consequently, the champion ST\u2010PSC delivers 13.78% power conversion efficiency (PCE), 31.1% average visible transmittance (AVT), and a high light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.29%. Notably, this study demonstrates for the first time efficient indoor operation of ST\u2010PSCs, achieving 22.41% indoor PCE (iPCE) under 1000 lux LED illumination, and further realizes the first scalable 30 \u00d7 30\u00a0cm2 semi\u2010transparent module retaining 8.2% (7.4%) PCE under 1 sun (0.2 sun). The unencapsulated ST\u2010PSCs retain 79.6% of initial PCE after 268 h of continuous standard light soaking.

While hydrogen is widely promoted, its low volumetric energy density, complex storage requirements, and limited infrastructure readiness raise questions about scalability. This Perspective paper argues that aluminum deserves attention as a strategic energy carrier. With an exceptionally high volumetric energy density, global availability, and full recyclability, aluminum offers unique advantages for seasonal storage and sector coupling. We highlight the promising high\u2010temperature aluminum\u2013steam oxidation pathway, which produces both heat and hydrogen alongside \u03b3\u2010Al2O3, directly recyclable in decarbonized smelting processes. Beyond technical feasibility, we discuss system\u2010level opportunities, from coupling aluminum\u2010based storage with renewable\u2010powered smelting plants to enabling multi\u2010service energy hubs for electricity and mobility. Preliminary techno\u2010economic assessments show that aluminum\u2010based hybrid cycles can achieve round\u2010trip efficiencies of 30\u201336% in power\u2010to\u2010power applications and competitive levelized costs for electricity and hydrogen production in the power\u2010to\u2010X framework. Moreover, key performance indexes show aluminum\u2010based hydrogen aboveground storage can reach densities exceeding Clean Hydrogen targets by a factor of seven, with competitive CAPEX and OPEX values. These results highlight aluminum's potential to complement or outperform hydrogen in enabling reliable, high\u2010density, and fully recyclable energy storage within decarbonized energy systems.",

The resulting anode sustains industrial\u2010level OER at 2.0 A cm\u22122 for 4,000 h in 1.0 M KOH and efficiently drives AEM water electrolysis in strongly alkaline freshwater and natural seawater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh\u2212valent transition\u2212metal (oxy)hydroxides commonly demonstrated high intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrochemical self\u2212reconstruction. However, this evolution inevitably compromises structural integrity and long\u2212term durability at industrial current densities (>1 A cm\u22122). Here, we propose a sequential\u2212engineering strategy that separates catalytic\u2212site activation from surface reconstruction through the preconfiguring of a ligand\u2212hole\u2212rich (oxy)hydroxide. Combined structural and electrochemical analyses confirm that Fe3+ oxidizes L\u2212cysteine into a moderated sulfur donor, enabling precise S incorporation (avoiding sulfides, e.g., Ni3S2), along with Fe\u2212O\u2212Ni inductive polarization, biasing Ni2+ toward NiIII. In parallel, the preconfigured high NiIII strengthens Ni\u2500O covalency, while sulfur incorporation introduces ligand holes to O\u22122p band, thereby rendering lattice oxygen electrophilic. This pre\u2212establishing framework allows lattice\u2212oxygen to precede oxidation at Ni sites, affecting a kinetic decoupling that underpins durability. Consequently, the S\u2212NiFeOOH delivers overpotentials of 182 mV and 214 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively, while sustaining over 4000 hours of continuous operation at 2.0 A cm\u22122. In an anion\u2212exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it achieves 1 A cm\u22122 at 1.67 V (freshwater) and 1.74 V (seawater) and maintains stable performance beyond 3,500 hours at 1.0 A cm\u22122, underscoring its promise for large\u2212scale green hydrogen production.",

This review offers mechanistic insights into imperfectly matched Si/Gr hybrid anodes, elucidating heterogeneous lithiation behavior and interfacial failure pathways, and thereby informing the design of durable, high\u2010energy\u2013density lithium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSilicon/graphite (Si/Gr) anodes, integrating Si's ultrahigh specific capacity with Gr's structural stability and electrical conductivity, have emerged as the most promising high\u2010capacity systems for next\u2010generation lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). The synergy between Si and Gr enables a balance between energy density, cycling stability, and manufacturability, already demonstrated in commercial cells.

Although Gr can alleviate stress and maintain conductivity, mismatched electrochemical kinetics and mechanical properties between Si and Gr lead to heterogeneous lithiation and complex interfacial evolution, posing major engineering challenges. This review highlights recent advances in the mechanistic understanding and engineering optimization of Si/Gr anodes, emphasizing failure modes originating from both individual component degradation and interfacial coupling. The roles of advanced characterization and multiscale modeling in revealing volume effects and interfacial dynamics are discussed. Building on these insights, optimization strategies such as nanoscale structuring, interfacial engineering, buffered conductive frameworks, gradient architectures, electrode design, and pre\u2010lithiation are summarized.
