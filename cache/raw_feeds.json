A notable challenge persists in realizing multistate spintronic devices with electrical control at nanoscale. Here, we propose a breakthrough strategy for achieving bias-controlled giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for multistate memory applications. Our design uses two-dimensional (2D) half-metals hosting strongly localized spin states (LSSs) at the Fermi level as two ferromagnet layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Multiple memory states emerge from bias-driven alignment/misalignment of LSSs on two sides, generating sudden tunneling pathway changes and distinguishable TMR. First-principles quantum transport simulations on MTJs based on 2D VCl\n    <sub>\n     3\n    </sub>\n    and FeCl\n    <sub>\n     2\n    </sub>\n    reveal unprecedented bias-controlled and widely modulable TMR ratios spanning \u2212194 to 2677% and\u00a0\u2212130 to 37,424%, respectively, accompanied by rare polarity switch capabilities. Our work opens a promising route for realizing electrical control of multistate spintronics.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

    "content": "Abstract\nChanges in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are believed to have affected the cycling of carbon isotopes \u03b413C $\\left({\\delta }^{13}C\\right)$ in both the ocean and the atmosphere. However, understanding how AMOC changes \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) distributions in the ocean is limited, since models do not typically decompose the various processes that affect \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$. Here, a new decomposition is applied to idealized simulations of an AMOC collapse, both for glacial and preindustrial conditions. The decomposition explicitly calculates the preformed and regenerated components of \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ and separates between physical and biological effects. An AMOC collapse leads to a large and rapid decrease in \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the North Atlantic, which is due to, in about equal parts, accumulation of remineralized organic matter and changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$, both in glacial and preindustrial simulations. In the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ increases by a smaller magnitude. This increase is dominated by changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the glacial simulation and remineralized \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the preindustrial simulation. An extensive evaluation of the decomposition shows that its errors are small in most cases, especially for large basin\u2010wide changes, whereas for small, local or global changes errors can be substantial. In contrast, approximations of the remineralized component based on Apparent Oxygen Utilization have large errors in most cases and are generally unreliable because they include contributions from oxygen disequilibrium."

Notwithstanding a partial synchronicity with the COVID-19 pandemic, this rapid global dissemination of more virulent GAS lineages has been promptly detected, as well as the molecular shifts underlying the observed changes in clinical patterns. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based genomic epidemiology allowed us to gain relevant insights into this upsurge as it was happening. This review integrates the canonical research publication-based approach with genomic data and metadata and identifies a subset of genomic clusters playing a major role in invasive GAS (iGAS) infections worldwide, which were named as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Global Pathogenic Lineages</span> (GPLs). The four GPLs broadly coincide with five sequence types (STs): GPL1 with ST28, GPL2 with ST15 and ST315, GPL3 with ST52, and GPL4 with ST39. While non-GPLs clusters maintain a baseline reservoir of antimicrobial\u2010resistance and virulence genes, GPLs show varying but noteworthy resistance profiles and are frequent causes of iGAS. The integration of WGS into routine diagnostics procedures is a forthcoming improvement, aimed not only at informing tailored therapy and implementing infection control strategies, but also to perform continuous surveillance. Ongoing WGS in clinical microbiology, as a matter of fact, will provide unparalleled insights into lineage emergence, transmission dynamics, and the geographic clustering of virulence and resistance determinants.</span>"

These materials incorporate living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, or algae, to enable unique functions like self-assembly, actuation, and dynamic interaction. By utilizing (micro)biological systems in material design, ELMs promise to transform industries including healthcare, construction, and agriculture. In the early phase of ELM technology development, researchers implemented a single living strain in an already established user material. However, the complexity and potential of these materials is limited by the abilities of this single strain. Even though synthetic biology brings the opportunity to add a range of nonnative bioactivities to these cells and thus the material, the increasing metabolic burden upon implementation of multiple nonnative pathways limits the capacity of a single strain. Furthermore, higher organisms and nonstandard hosts are often desired in material settings for their native physical or metabolic advantages. However these are not always straightforward to further engineer. Thus, the use of multiple, specialized strains broadens the functionalities and thus the applicability of ELMs. Multistrain ELMs are a brand-new technology, with many promising applications.</span>"

SRB\u2010specific lipids showed eightfold higher DI13C\u2010assimilation than ANME lipids, suggesting SRB directly assimilate DIC, while ANME assimilate an alternative carbon source, potentially provided by SRBs.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn cold seeps, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate\u2010reducing bacteria (SRB) oxidise methane to inorganic carbon (IC) coupled to sulphate reduction. While catabolic pathways are well resolved, carbon flow into biomass as well as the functional roles of lipid biomarkers remain unclear. We conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid\u2010SIP) experiments with Astoria Canyon sediments dominated by ANME\u20102/SRB consortia and incubated samples with either 13C\u2010labelled methane (13CH4) or dissolved IC (DI13C). Lipid\u2010specific \u03b413C analysis showed higher 13C incorporation from DI13C than from 13CH4. After 30\u2009days, \u03b413C values were up to +417\u2030 in SRB\u2010specific fatty acids (e.g., C16:1\u03c95c, cyC17:0\u03c95,6) and +126\u2030 in ANME\u20102\u2010specific isoprenoid lipids (e.g., archaeol, crocetane). Based on these values, we calculated carbon assimilation rates and found that both partners primarily assimilate IC. Remarkably, IC assimilation in SRB lipids was eight times higher than in ANME lipids, suggesting that ANME may use additional yet\u2010to\u2010be\u2010identified carbon sources, potentially produced by their partner SRB. By examining the stepwise 13C\u2010enrichment of ANME\u2010 and SRB\u2010derived lipids, we further delineate biosynthetic pathways for archaeal and bacterial diether lipid formation and highlight crocetane as a bilayer\u2010modulating isoprenoid hydrocarbon potentially affecting membrane fluidity and proton permeability."

    "link": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JG009072?af=R",
    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the balance between denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in riparian systems is essential for managing watershed nitrogen (N) budgets and evaluating restoration practices. This balance is influenced by several factors including concentrations and ratio of various organic and inorganic electron donors (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Fe2+) to acceptor (NO3\u2212). In riparian sediments, these factors can change rapidly over space and time, complicating measurement and quantification. We used a PFLOTRAN batch reactor model calibrated to laboratory microcosm experiments where the denitrification and DNRA rates in riparian sediments were measured using 15N stable isotopes. Although DOC/NO3\u2212 ratios influenced the relative proportions of denitrification and DNRA, the processes were also affected by elemental concentrations. For a starting DOC concentration of 0.12\u00a0mgL\u22121, DNRA exceeded denitrification at DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a06; however, this shift was not observed within a range of DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a030 at higher DOC concentration of 12\u00a0mgL\u22121. Heterotrophic pathways dominated NO3\u2010N reduction with smaller contribution from autotrophic pathways. These findings suggest that although heterotrophic pathways are important in carbon\u2010rich sediments, autotrophic pathways can be significant in carbon\u2010depleted conditions in the presence of inorganic electron donors such as Fe2+. Our simulations also highlighted key challenges with constraining model rate constants and parameters and the need for site specific calibrations. This work highlights the value of process\u2010based modeling in quantifying denitrification\u2010DNRA partitioning and the variable controls of electron donors and acceptors. Such simulations could be extended to riparian buffers to determine if they are effective management sinks for N mitigation."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study studies the predictability of the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) for the eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) over the past 142\u00a0years from 1880\u20132021 by exploring its fastest error growth. This is implemented by applying the climate\u2010relevant singular vector (CSV) analysis onto a tropical intermediate coupled model. Emphasis places on identifying the optimal perturbation that can result in the fastest prediction error growth of the EIO SSTA. It is found that, with the 6\u2010month lead prediction, the spatial pattern of the optimal initial perturbations is characterized by a negative SSTA pole with the diverged surface wind in the southern Indian Ocean and a positive SSTA pole with the converged surface wind in the eastern Pacific. The growth rate of optimal initial perturbation, as measured by the leading singular value, exhibits significant interannual variation consistent with the variation of the SSTA in EIO. Specifically, when the SSTA in the EIO is colder, the prediction error grows more rapidly, and conversely, when the SSTA is warmer, the error grows more slowly. The results of the dynamical analysis show that a cold SSTA background strengthens Ekman feedback through both atmospheric and oceanic responses, leading to faster growth of prediction errors. This study enhances our understanding to the predictability in the Indian Ocean, in particular the role of EIO in the Indian Ocean dipole predictability."

    "content": "Abstract\nSatellite\u2010derived sea ice products and ice model simulations are analyzed in the Bering Sea during the winters of 2018\u20132019, featuring historically low sea ice coverage on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf, and 2019\u20132020, when ice conditions were close to average. Hindcast simulations are conducted using the Community sea Ice CodE (CICE) as a standalone regional ice model forced with ERA5 atmospheric fields and oceanic fields derived from realizations of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) internally coupled with its own ice model component. CICE is able to predict the observed seasonal variability in ice concentration and ice thickness provided that ocean mixed layer temperature and salinity are strongly nudged toward an accurate ocean state. Ice mass balance analysis shows that sustained periods of southerly wind during the 2018\u201319 season led to increased melting and a larger ice export into the Arctic when compared to 2019\u201320. More ice was produced in 2018\u201319, the season with lower sea ice areal extent, offset by larger melting and transport out of the domain. The volume of ice exported to the Russian shelf and basin is comparable to the net transport through the Bering Strait. The consistency between the model and satellite products demonstrates that the representation of sea ice thermodynamic and dynamic models present in CICE are adequate for representing key physical processes driving sea ice variability in this region during both low and normal ice coverage years."

    "content": "Abstract\nInternal waves and geostrophic motions contribute to sea surface height (SSH) variability at scales order 100\u00a0km and smaller. Although geostrophic motions have a well\u2010defined contribution in SSH, the internal wave contribution is complex and small enough to be confounded with noise. This has impeded attempts to separate internal wave effects from geostrophic signals in SSH measurements. Shipboard acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) data combined with along\u2010track satellite altimetry are used to estimate the internal\u2010wave component of the SSH wavenumber spectrum in the southeast tropical Pacific. A modified wave\u2010vortex kinetic energy (KE) decomposition in combination with linear wave theory and the Garrett\u2010Munk model are used to convert the ADCP\u2010inferred wave KE spectrum into an SSH spectrum representative of the wave continuum. The continuum component explains the SSH spectral slope (\u223c\u22122) $(\\sim -2)$ of this area. The full SSH spectrum is reconstructed as the sum of the contributions from the internal wave continuum, the geostrophically balanced (\u201cvortex\u201d) component, internal tides, and altimeter noise. The SSH spectra of internal tides and altimeter noise are derived from models. The reconstruction recovers 80% of the observed variance at large scales and 60% within the semidiurnal internal tide band. The residual between this reconstruction and the altimetry\u2010derived spectrum is interpreted as nonstationary internal tidal energy. The nonstationary tide is more energetic than suggested by previous altimeter\u2010based estimates, highlighting the challenge of extracting geostrophic signals from SSH."

Yet, the fine\u2010scale structure, variability, and long\u2010term evolution of its water masses and nutrient concentrations remain poorly characterized. Here, we combine almost two decades of high\u2010resolution hydrographic and biogeochemical data (2006\u20132024) to resolve the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient availability and water mass (WM) properties across this key arctic gateway. Using unsupervised clustering and tracer\u2010based diagnostics, we identify three dominant WM regimes shaped by Arctic and Atlantic influences, glacial inputs, and internal mixing. Our analysis reveals net freshening and nutrient shifts across all major water masses, including a doubling of nutrient concentrations in the arctic upper halocline as well as significant freshening of Polar Mode Water and Baffin Bay Polar Water properties. This multidecadal analysis provides crucial insights into the complex drivers of hydrographic and nutrient changes, enhancing our ability to predict how Arctic productivity will evolve."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe lucinid clam Lucinoma capensis thrives at the oxygen minimum zone margins in the Benguela Upwelling System, where oxygen levels fluctuate dramatically. Understanding its adaptation to such extreme conditions provides key insights into survival strategies under fluctuating oxygen availability. We investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of L. capensis under normoxia, hypoxia, and recovery, focusing on the gills and digestive gland. Our findings highlight distinct organ\u2010specific responses, with the gills showing strong transcriptional changes to oxygen fluctuations, in contrast to the more stable profile observed in the digestive gland. Under hypoxic conditions, the gills exhibited coordinated downregulation of protein synthesis, transposable element activity, and immune function, suggesting a tightly regulated energy conservation strategy and mechanisms to preserve symbiont stability and genomic integrity. Activation of prokaryotic metabolism in the gills supports the symbionts' role in host energy acquisition and sulfide detoxification during hypoxia. In contrast, the digestive gland showed minimal transcriptional shifts during anoxia, with upregulation of pathways supporting structural maintenance. Upon reoxygenation, the gills displayed an active and asymmetric recovery, characterised by rapid restoration of protein synthesis and gradual normalisation of protein degradation and immune functions. Despite significant transcriptomic changes, the metabolome remained largely stable, reflecting L. capensis's resilience to oxygen fluctuations. However, an overshoot in TCA cycle intermediates and derepression of previously downregulated pathways indicate that reoxygenation involves active metabolic reprogramming, not merely a return to baseline. This study highlights the specialised tissue responses and symbiotic contributions that enable L. capensis to thrive in one of the ocean's most challenging environments."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe marine environment comprises vast regions without physical barriers to movement, making the understanding of population isolation and the evolution of diversity challenging. This is especially the case for highly mobile marine species. Here we investigate populations of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) across the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic using high\u2010resolution genomic markers (RADseq) and stable isotope analyses to better understand the evolution of population structure in this system. High\u2010resolution genomic data and broad geographic sampling revealed patterns of structure not previously identified, and integration with stable isotope data suggests that prey choice varies across this region. Unexpected patterns included genetic and isotopic similarity between the North Atlantic and the region around Sicily (but not including the medially located Gulf of C\u00e1diz and surrounding regions). The regional habitat within and beyond the Mediterranean Sea is structured with ocean frontal systems including thermal and halocline transitions, several of which show alignment with genetic transitions within our data. Our data help to distinguish among possible drivers of population differentiation for a marine predator that has the potential for long\u2010distance dispersion."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nPast population dynamics during the Pleistocene ice age and the Holocene era have profoundly influenced the genetic structure and diversity of species. Environmental heterogeneity has further shaped local and regional adaptive variation. Here, we ask how historical processes have led to the current genetic diversity of a key North American species across its vast natural range and what genomic signatures indicate regional adaptive divergence and local adaptation. We used sequencing data from 1903 Populus tremuloides Michx. (quaking aspen) trees to assess historical population dynamics and identify genotype \u2013environment associations within and among the species' major genetic lineages. The two northern and western North American aspen lineages exhibited historical population expansion patterns, while the southernmost lineage experienced a historical bottleneck consistent with past glacial oscillations. We found that the earliest split between genetic lineages of P. tremuloides occurred in the southern part of its distribution range. We further identified larger blocks of adaptive SNPs within separate genomic sequence regions on chromosomes 2 and 8 that may exhibit suppressed genetic recombination, contributing to the maintenance of regional and local adaptation in the species. Our study provides key insights into the evolutionary processes affecting adaptive genetic variation and phylogeography at a broad continental and regional scale, with implications for predicting species' responses to future climate change."

Unfortunately, the number of sustainable practices needed to support production, ecosystem services and land conservation remains virtually unknown. We compiled a database of 1570 observations from 349 sites in 57 countries to assess how the number of sustainable practices influences multiple ecosystem services. Our findings reveal that a high number of sustainable practices is crucial for enhancing agroecosystem services such as soil carbon storage, fertility and microbial habitat while supporting yield. Sustainable practices such as crop rotation, limited tillage and incorporation of crop residues were especially important. North America, Eastern Europe and China were particularly dependent on the use of multiple sustainable practices to maintain ecosystem services. Findings underscore the need for integrative strategies employing multiple sustainable practices for mitigating global change, ensuring food security and sustaining ecosystems."

    "content": "<p>by Xitong Luo, Lei Zhang, Yafeng Pan</p>\n\nWe often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence\u2014from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence\u2014has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human communications. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees\u2019 opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees\u2019 opinions (Studies 1 & 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 & 4). Our findings reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees\u2019 opinions (we refer to this as the <i>alignment bias</i>) (Study 1). This tendency, which reflects normative conformity, persists even when advisors were directly incentivized to provide accurate advice (Study 2). As feedback is introduced, advisors\u2019 behavior shifts in ways best captured by a reinforcement learning model, suggesting that advisees\u2019 feedback drives adaptations in advice giving that maximize acceptance and minimize rejection (Study 3). This adaptation persisted even when acceptance is rare, as bolstered by the model-based evidence (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors\u2019 susceptibility to the consequence of giving advice, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters."

Here, we report the role of microtubule (MT) nanotubes in rendering the <i>Drosophila</i> micropyle functional, a structure essential for sperm entry during fertilization. Our study highlights that MT-nanotubes emanate from the apical end of the specialized epithelial cells called the polar cells in late oogenesis, forming a narrow channel through the eggshell. Utilizing a combination of fly genetics, live cell imaging, and tissue immunochemistry, our research elucidates the structural and functional characteristics of the polar cell nanotube. We show that tubulin is vital for the formation of these nanotubes, which are enriched in the lateral membrane marker, Fasciclin III. Moreover, the overall polarity of the migrating cell cluster is critical for the successful development of the micropyle. Notably, both lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking within the polar cells are essential for the opening of the vitelline layer, further facilitating the micropyle\u2019s role in fertilization."

Here we found that Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), a neuron-specific protein in the brain, played an important role in dictating synaptic NMDAR subunit composition in spinal cord somatostatin-positive (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neuron, a key component in the spinal circuit transmitting mechanical pain in mice. Our data showed that the protein level of RIN1 was low early after birth, which progressively increased with synapse maturation and promoted the switch from synaptic GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs. In adult mice, the nerve injury-induced pathological pain paralleled a significant increase of RIN1 protein in spinal SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons, which drove a new round of GluN2B-to-GluN2A switching at mature synapses. Our data revealed the molecular mechanisms by which RIN1 differentially regulated the synaptic trafficking of GluN2B and GluN2A receptors, and implied that RIN1-mediated pathological switch of NMDAR subunit composition strikingly altered the analgesic efficacy of distinct NMDAR subunit antagonists with the development of neuropathic pain."

Here, we show that supplementation of multiple low-dose nutrients\u2014an important environmental factor contributing to ASD\u2014can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in mice. First, we used <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, a well-established model of ASD, to investigate the effect of nutrient cocktails containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine, all of which are known to regulate synapse formation and activity. Supplementation of nutrient cocktails for 7 days altered total proteomes by increasing synapse-related proteins. Our results further reveal that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Nutrient supplementation normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA neurons in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement mixtures containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in <i>Nf1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> and <i>Cttnbp2</i><sup>+/M120I</sup> mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models."

    "content": "Abstract\nVolatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)\u2014carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and carbon disulfide (CS2)\u2014play critical roles in atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, quantitative understanding of VSC exchange dynamics in coastal wetland ecosystems remains limited. Here, we quantified the sediment\u2010air fluxes of these VSCs across vegetated (Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda glauca) and unvegetated mudflat habitats via year\u2010round field observations in a temperate intertidal wetland. We found that S. alterniflora sediments exhibited net emissions of COS (4.61\u2009\u00b1\u20099.19\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), DMS (10.25\u2009\u00b1\u200912.35\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), and CS2 (5.77\u2009\u00b1\u20097.29\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), while S. glauca and mudflats exhibited variable sink\u2013source dynamics. VSC fluxes from S. alterniflora habitats significantly exceeded those from other zones due to high root sulfate and total sulfur contents, as well as microbial organisms and temperature\u2010dependent microbial activity related to sulfur metabolism. The DMS flux in S. alterniflora zones decreased by 33\u2013224% after ebb tide compared to before flooding, with principal component analysis identifying phase\u2010specific controls: pre\u2010flood fluxes were associated with porewater chemistry (pH, redox potential) and atmosphere (water content, pressure) coupling, while post\u2010ebb fluxes were governed by ionic gradients (conductivity) and residual moisture (water content). Tidal simulation experiments revealed the joint influences of illumination, water content, and anaerobic processes on VSC production, where anaerobic conditions suppressed DMS and CS2 formation but enhanced COS emission in the dark. These findings establish that coastal VSC fluxes are regulated by the interplay between macrophyte\u2010mediated sediment biogeochemistry and tidal pumping. This provides mechanistic insights into wetland sulfur cycle modeling."

    "content": "Mechanistic models are central to quantitative understanding and optimisation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture processes, but their utility is often restricted by parameter sets calibrated for specific cell lines, scales, or operating conditions. In this study, we present the application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to bioprocessing, introducing an ensemble-based framework for dual state and parameter estimation that enables mechanistic model adaptation across distinct systems. The EnKF recursively assimilates process measurements to update uncertain kinetic parameters and predict system states, allowing a model developed for one system to be transferred to a new one without reparametrisation and using only a single experimental dataset. The evolving parameter ensembles provide a time-resolved sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters have dominant influence under new process conditions and when their effects become significant. The framework was evaluated across six CHO cell experimental datasets differing in scale, cell line, temperature, and feeding strategy, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of system dynamics and progressive improvement in long-term predictions as new data became available. By maintaining full mechanistic transparency while flexibly adapting to new data, the EnKF offers a practical route for knowledge transfer across systems, strengthening the role of mechanistic modelling in data-informed bioprocess understanding and control."

    "content": "Tumor growth and resistance arise from the interplay between cell-cycle dysregulation and the spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). While spatial transcriptomics now enables molecular profiling of intact tissues, it captures only static molecular states, making it challenging to reconstruct dynamic processes such as proliferation. Here, we develop SpaceCycle, a computational framework that infers the continuous cell-cycle phase and associated oscillatory gene expression dynamics from spatial transcriptomic data. Using human melanoma, breast, and lung tumors, we map both discrete and continuous cell-cycle states across entire tissue sections to reveal how proliferative activity is spatially structured within the TME. We find that cycling and non-cycling cells form distinct spatial niches reflecting differences in vascularization, immune composition, and cellular density. Continuous-phase inference further exposes tumor-specific variations in cell cycle phase durations and uncovers oscillatory programs. Together, our results provide a spatiotemporal view of cell-cycle organization in human tumors and establish a general framework for detecting dynamic transcriptional programs and spatial proliferation patterns from static tissue data."

    "content": "Fine-tuned regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity is essential for accurate gene expression. A key layer of this regulation involves phosphorylation of Pol II's C-terminal domain (CTD), a repetitive heptapeptide tail that coordinates transcription and RNA-processing factors. The kinase P-TEFb plays a major role in this process, yet its precise phosphorylation mechanism remains unclear. Previous in vitro studies have suggested a distributive mode of action based largely on qualitative inspection of mass spectrometry data rather than quantitative analysis. Here, we use mathematical modeling of CTD phosphorylation to explore whether local context, such as neighboring phosphorylations or directional biases, affects P-TEFb activity on the CTD. Our results indicate that P-TEFb acts distributively but with pronounced local cooperativity: repeats adjacent to phosphorylated sites are modified at higher rates. We find no evidence for directional bias, although the limited positional resolution of the data precludes a definitive conclusion. These results identify local context as an important factor in P-TEFb-mediated CTD phosphorylation and establish a quantitative modeling framework for dissecting multi-site modification dynamics."

    "content": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) arises from coupled interactions between blood flow, tissue mechanics, and cellular signaling. Hemodynamic forces influence endothelial and interstitial cell behavior, while the resulting tissue remodeling alters valve motion and flow patterns. Capturing this two-way feedback requires models that integrate fluid-structure mechanics with biochemical regulation, yet such multiscale coupling remains technically challenging. Previous computational models have focused on isolated aspects of the disease: fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations reproduce valve deformation and flow, and systems biology (SB) models describe molecular signaling that drives fibrosis and calcification. However, without coupling, these approaches cannot predict how mechanical dysfunction initiates biochemical remodeling or how biochemical changes feed back on mechanics. Here, we present a multi-physics computational framework that couples three-dimensional FSI simulations of aortic valve dynamics with a mechanistic SB model of calcification signaling. The FSI module resolves pulsatile blood flow and leaflet deformation, yielding local wall shear stresses and tissue strains throughout the cardiac cycle. These mechanical quantities are used as inputs to the SB module, which represents key biochemical pathways governing inflammation, TGF-{beta}/SMAD signaling, and nitric-oxide (NO)--mediated inhibition within valvular cells. Simulations predict long-term calcification trajectories for valves of varying thickness, showing that fibrosis-induced stiffening lowers shear stress, reduces NO synthesis, and enhances TGF-{beta} activation, thereby accelerating calcification. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing future incorporation of additional pathways, as well as implementation of full two-way coupling between the FSI and SB models. By integrating physics-based hemodynamics with systems-level biochemistry, this study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a next-generation, multi-scale modeling platform for studying cardiovascular disease that unites blood flow dynamics and biochemical signaling."

To address the challenge of high-throughput screening in filamentous fungi, we developed methods to construct a genome-wide barcoded insertional mutant library in Trichoderma atroviride, a filamentous fungus widely used as a biocontrol agent against bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Our strategy leveraged randomly barcoded transfer DNA insertions from plasmid libraries containing hundreds of millions of unique DNA barcodes and a broad host-range drug resistance marker delivered via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into T. atroviride. By optimizing transformation conditions, we achieved up to 600 independent transformants per infection event, resulting in a library of over 31,000 mapped insertions disrupting 7,115 of the 11,828 predicted genes in the T. atroviride genome. This resource establishes a scalable platform for high-throughput functional genomics in filamentous fungi, enabling both fundamental investigations of fungal biology and engineering approaches toward improved medical applications, biotechnology, and sustainable agriculture."

    "content": "Classical microbiology has focused on directly suppressing pathogens using drugs, ignoring other harmless microbial species living alongside the pathogens. We now have a much better understanding of how species interact and affect one another's growth within microbial communities, for example through chemical production. Here we capitalize on this understanding to demonstrate how one can manipulate and control the strength of interactions between bacterial species, and combine this with antibiotics to fully suppress and eliminate pathogens. Using experiments and a mathematical model, we first show how Citrobacter freundii can reduce the environmental pH to enhance the effect of ampicillin on the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This negative interaction from C. freundii to P. aeruginosa can be strengthened by increasing glucose concentrations. Our proof-of-concept approach also worked against other pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a different commensal: Lactobacillus plantarum, a common probiotic species. Overall, we show that taking advantage of the community and chemical context in which microbes live can help to develop efficient strategies to control them. In the medical context, this approach can help to eliminate pathogens thereby reducing our reliance on antibiotics."

    "content": "Crawling motility is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells and requires a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, regulated adhesion, and spatially organized signalling pathways. Asgard archaea (phylum Promethearchaeota) which are considered the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes potentially encode these functions within their large set of eukaryotic signature proteins. The few cultivated members show a complex cell morphology, consisting of a central cell body from which several protrusions extend, filled with an actin-based cytoskeleton. Here, live cell microscopy of two organisms of the Loki- and Hodarchaea lineages showed that they dynamically and drastically change their cell shape on a minute time scale and grow and retract their extensive protrusions with a speed of 1.5 to 5.3 micron/min, respectively. After adhering to a glass surface, cells employ their protrusions to undergo active crawling motion. In the presence of selected actin inhibitors however, the observed dynamics were arrested, suggesting a central role of actin in these processes. The observed cellular plasticity and motility are unique features among prokaryotes and might have been crucial for the emergence of the first eukaryotic cells that are thought to have formed through the association of a member of the Promethearchaeota and an alphaproteobacterium, the ancestor of mitochondria."

We report that Plectosphaerella cucumerina is a core member of the Arabidopsis thaliana root microbiota displaying high pathogenic potential and multi-host colonization capabilities. Establishment of a Plectosphaerella reference culture collection, followed by whole-genome sequencing of 72 strains reveals subtle phenotypic and genotypic variation that associate with fungal phylogeny, but not host plant identity. Transcriptome profiling of a model P. cucumerina isolate in roots of multiple hosts identifies core and host-specific fungal processes linked to carbon catabolism and root cell wall deconstruction of the hosts. A fungal gene encoding a candidate Beta-1,3-glucanase (GH64) was identified as a key genetic factor driving infection and disease in plants that diverged 110 million years ago. The gene is enriched in plant-colonizing fungi and consistently functions as a disease determinant in the root pathogen Colletotrichum incanum. We conclude that diverse and tunable fungal repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes act as disease determinants and drive multi-host compatibility belowground."

    "content": "Despite microorganisms being primarily responsible for landfill material decomposition, limited characterization has been performed across both landfill depth and age. Here, we investigated the microbial communities and physicochemical parameters in two active and two closed landfill wells from surface to bottom, as well as fill dirt and leachate at a sanitary landfill near Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Amplicon community sequencing fungi, bacteria and archaea revealed distinct microbial community structures across landfill sites. The observed patterns of microbial community succession by depth and age mirror the known phases of the landfill life cycle. Younger surface samples were dominated by aerobic fungi, which transitioned to fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in older, deeper, layers. Simultaneously, high species richness was preserved across landfill ages, while reduced evenness at specific depths support spatial niche differentiation. In conjunction with the lack of trends found for physicochemical parameters by depth, this supports niche differentiation driven by the highly heterogenous waste inputs. This study provides the first comprehensive vertical profile of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across landfill depths and ages, highlighting the influence of these parameters on physicochemical factors and microbial distribution within landfills. These results have implications for improving landfill management, including renewable gas energy production, minimizing emissions, and increasing degradation rates."

    "content": "Picocyanobacteria from the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus thrive across the globe in aqueous environments, have relatively small genomes, and have growth dynamics regulated by both viral interactions and abiotic conditions, making them excellent model organisms for exploring host-pathogen coevolution. The Salish Sea, located in the Western coastal waters bordering the USA and Canada, is at the current northern boundary (defined by Prochlorococcus versus Synechococcus prevalence ratios) of the range of Prochlorococcus. Predictions suggest that this boundary will shift as warmer waters move northward, providing an excellent system to study host-pathogen dynamics and coevolution in a changing environmental context. In preparation for such studies, we developed and refined methods to sample and sequence cyanobacteria, cyanophages, and their abiotic environment. In addition to basic methodological questions focused on the physical sampling, filtering, viral precipitation, DNA extraction, and technical replicability, we explored how well our filtering and extraction protocols enrich for our main target, picocyanobacteria. The protocol described herein can successfully discriminate large-cell eukaryotic organisms, but size fractionation of picocyanobacteria appears to be affected by the presence of free DNA, multicellular structures, and abundant tycheposons. Our preferred final protocol at the conclusion of these experiments based on yield and processing time is presented. We recovered substantial Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and amoeba-like sequences in most samples, and preliminary exploration of relative taxon sequence read recoveries across locations, over time, and tidal conditions are also discussed. Approaches described here may be useful to other efforts such as harmful algal bloom monitoring, species isolation and enrichment, water quality assessments, anti-viral discovery, and understanding picocyanobacterial population changes over space and time."

    "content": "Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the mite-borne human disease scrub typhus. The species is characterised by having many strains that differ in their ability to cause disease in murine infection models and in human patients. The genomes of a diverse set of Orientia tsutsugamushi strains have recently been analysed in detail, revealing broadly similar gene content with genomes differing primarily in synteny and in the composition of a large arsenal of predicted secreted effector proteins. Given the similarity in gene content, here we asked whether the observed differences in virulence were driven by genome-wide differences in gene expression of bacterial genes, and differences in the ensuing response of infected host cells. To explore this, we carried out a dual RNA sequencing analysis of eight diverse strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi grown in cultured human endothelial cells. An overall analysis found no clear patterns in the bacterial or host gene expression patterns that correlate with the ability to cause disease. We found that all strains induce a strong type 1 interferon response in endothelial cells, but that within that broad response each strain has a unique fingerprint of induced genes likely leading to different disease outcomes when combined with a complex immune system in vivo. We compared expression levels of orthologous genes between different strains and identified some bacterial pathways with constant expression levels whilst others were more variable, leading to the identification of specific pathways under tight transcriptional control during cellular infection. Together our data show that inter-strain differences in virulence are not defined by expression levels of any one set of bacterial or host genes and also reveal insights into transcriptional regulation of different pathways in Orientia tsutsugamushi."

    "content": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-originspecific epigenetic mechanism with essential roles in placental development and fetal growth in mice, but its contribution to brain function and evolution remains unclear. Here, we investigated genomic imprinting in the ferret, a gyrencephalic mammal whose cortical architecture closely resembles that of humans rather than mice. Guided by human imprinting datasets, we screened 65 candidate genes in ferret brain and identified paternal expression of Adam23, maternal expression of Atp10a, and biallelic expression of genes including PXDC1, WRB and UBE3A. Adam23 showed paternal expression in ferret cortex, particularly in the occipital region, whereas it was biallelically expressed in mouse brain. In human SH-SY5Y cells, Adam23 was biallelic in undifferentiated cells but shifted toward monoallelic expression upon neuronal differentiation. CpG analysis of upstream islands indicated that Adam23 imprinting in ferrets is independent of promoter methylation, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism. Functional assays in Neuro-2aTG cells showed that Adam23 knockdown enhances neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression promotes cell proliferation. These findings identify Adam23 as a non-canonical imprinted gene whose dosage influences stem cell dynamics and neurite development, linking imprinting to the evolution of gyrencephalic cortical structures and highlighting the ferret as a valuable model for imprinting studies in higher-order brain function."

    "content": "The multidrug resistance (MDR) problem in Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is becoming increasingly severe, necessitating the development of novel antibacterial agents and strategies. In this study, seven Elaiophylin derivatives were isolated from Streptomyces sp. WS-30248, and the antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of the principal compound, Elaiophylin, against S. suis were systematically evaluated for the first time. Through comprehensive approaches including in vitro efficacy assays, biofilm inhibition and eradication tests, bacterial membrane integrity analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level detection, and a mouse infection model, Elaiophylin was found to exhibit significant antibacterial activity against multiple clinically MDR S. suis strains. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 0.5 g/mL, and complete bactericidal activity was achieved within 24 hours at 4xMIC. The compound effectively inhibited and eradicated bacterial biofilms, directly killing embedded cells within the biofilm matrix. Mechanistic studies revealed that Elaiophylin functions through multiple synergistic pathways, including disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and induction of massive ROS accumulation, thereby interfering with the proton motive force (PMF), depleting intracellular ATP, and blocking energy metabolism. In the mouse infection model, the Elaiophylin-treated group showed a significantly increased survival rate of 60% and effectively reduced bacterial loads in tissues. This study demonstrates that Elaiophylin is a highly promising natural candidate drug with multi-target synergistic effects, offering a new strategy to combat MDR S. suis and biofilm-associated infections."

We show in this study that Aer also senses oxidative stress and performs FAD-dependent negative chemotaxis in response to the known ROS H2O2. The ability of Aer to detect both oxidizing and reducing intracellular environments redefines its functional range and establishes Aer as a bidirectional redox sensor. We show in addition that the ability of bacterial swarms to move away from bactericidal antibiotics is Aer-dependent and is abolished by expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG, which scavenges intracellular ROS. Our study thus provides independent behavioral evidence that certain antibiotics generate intracellular ROS, while also offering a sensitive assay for detecting these reactive species."

    "content": "Intracellular bacterial symbioses have arisen myriad times in eukaryotes, with dozens known from insects alone. Beginning with Buchnera, the obligate endosymbiont of aphids, genomes of endosymbionts have illuminated their evolutionary origins and metabolic contributions to hosts. However, the mechanisms by which nonculturable endosymbionts enter host cells and suppress cellular immune processes have remained unknown. We show that an uncharacterized Buchnera protein, here designated SyeA, was present in the Buchnera ancestor, is secreted and homologous to secreted effectors of bacterial pathogens and is essential for Buchnera transmission. Buchnera is transmitted via expulsion from specialized maternal cells and uptake by embryos. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that SyeA levels peak upon colonization, accompanied by actin accumulation at the entry site. SyeA localizes outside the host-derived membrane and actin layer surrounding each Buchnera cell and colocalizes in host cytoplasm with Rho1, which regulates actin polymerization. syeA knockdown disrupts colonization and embryonic development and elevates lysosomal activity, leading to Buchnera destruction6. Our findings provide rare insight into how an anciently associated, mutualistic endosymbiont achieves its intracellular existence. SyeA is a vestige of pathogenic origins followed by evolution of increased host control and erosion of the original, more complex pathogenicity machinery."

Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of 191 wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from six populations from Alaskan lakes spanning a gradient of surface area. We tested how environmental context (lake size and ecotype) and host traits (sex, body mass, gravidity, Schistocephalus solidus (S. solidus) infection, and fibrosis) influence stickleback gut microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the lake surface area strongly predicted fish gut microbial alpha diversity. Fish from intermediate-sized lakes harbored significantly more diverse microbiota than those from small and large lakes, independent of ecotype. Body mass was associated with gut microbial diversity. Model-predicted marginal effects from the mass and lake surface area interaction analysis showed that the association between fish mass and microbial alpha diversity was strongly negative in the smallest lakes, weakest in intermediate-sized lakes, and strongly positive in the largest lakes. In addition, sex and S. solidus infection were significantly associated with gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity, whereas fibrosis and gravidity showed minimal effects. Differential abundance analysis revealed lake size-dependent associations between body mass and individual taxa. Together, these results demonstrate that both habitat context and host variation interactively shape stickleback gut microbial communities in the wild. Integrating lake-level and individual-level analyses reveals how ecological setting modulates host-microbe associations, offering insights into the role of the gut microbiota in host adaptation and population divergence."

In Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/Y/Z assembly associates with and translocates across the nucleoid in a PomZ ATPase-dependent manner to position the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring at midcell. Unlike other systems incorporating a ParA/MinD ATPase, the PomX/Y/Z system incorporates two ATPase Activating Proteins (AAPs), PomX and PomY, that stimulate PomZ activity. While PomX AAP activity, similarly to other characterized AAPs of ParA/MinD ATPases, resides in a short positively charged N-terminal peptide (PomXNPEP), the mechanism of PomY-mediated activation of PomZ remained unknown. We map PomY AAP activity to its C-terminal residues 496-682 (PomY496-682) and show that this activity is important for division site positioning and the initiation of cell division. Structural modeling suggests a bipartite PomY496-682 architecture, comprising a globular domain and an intrinsically disordered region containing the short 5 helix. However, modeling supported an interaction only between 5 and the PomZ dimer. The 5 binding site partially overlaps with that of the prototype AAP ParB on the ParA dimer but 5 lacks a positively charged residue critical for ParB AAP activity. Modeling supported that PomXNPEP binds the PomZ dimer at a site distinct from that of 5 and which overlaps with that of the prototype AAP MinE on the MinD dimer. These findings reveal a non-canonical AAP mechanism of PomY, while PomXNPEP likely functions analogously to MinE, indicating that PomX and PomY act in concert through distinct but complementary mechanisms to stimulate PomZ ATPase activity, thereby efficiently driving the positioning of the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring."

    "content": "Multiple enteroviruses are associated with life-threatening and economically important diseases, yet licensed vaccines are available only against poliovirus (worldwide) and enterovirus A71 (China). Both live attenuated and inactivated anti-poliovirus vaccines, while highly successful in preventing the disease, have important shortcomings. Live vaccine strains are inherently genetically unstable and can regain virulence, leading to re-emergence of paralytic disease. Inactivated vaccine does not induce the mucosal immunity sufficient to interrupt viral transmission and is made from virulent strains, presenting a biosafety challenge. Recent alternatives, such as new vaccine strains with improved genetic stability and VLP-based vaccines, only partially address these concerns. Here, we investigated another approach to the development of anti-enterovirus vaccines based on efficient trans-encaspidation of replication-competent enterovirus RNAs coding for only the non-structural proteins (replicons) by Newcastle Disease virus vectors expressing enterovirus capsid proteins. Thus, the encapsidated replicon production is driven by effectively replicating enterovirus RNA and the NDV vector. This system is easily scalable and can be adapted to any cell culture provided it can be infected by both the enterovirus and NDV. Unlike the empty VLPs, the encapsidated replicons recapitulate the stability and antigenicity of native enterovirus particles, but cannot propagate beyond the originally infected cell. The protective efficacy of an encapsidated poliovirus replicon immunization was similar to that of the licensed Sabin vaccine strain in a murine model. This approach can easily be adapted to any enterovirus, allowing the rapid development of new, affordable vaccine candidates."

    "content": "Archaea of the order Sulfolobales possess eukaryotic-like cell cycle. The chromatin organization in these archaea is supposed to rely on nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Genomes of Sulfolobales species encode multiple members of the Lrs14 protein family, which have been postulated to function as NAPs. Here, we show that one of the Lrs14 family protein, named Sul14a, is a potential key player in dynamic chromatin organization in Saccharolobus islandicus. Sul14a is transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and appears to be essential for cell viability. The protein exhibits DNA-binding activity preferring AT-rich sequences and can bridge DNA in vitro. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Sul14a is enriched at AT-rich regions of the chromatin. Overexpression of Sul14a leads to cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and transcriptomic analyses indicate that Sul14a overexpression results in chromatin contact reduction and global transcriptional changes. In addition, we observed that the chromatin contact pattern changes markedly between 1h and 5h after release from G2 synchronization, corresponding to the lowest and highest levels of sul14a transcription, respectively, during the cell cycle. Our results establish that Sul14a is an NAP intimately associated with chromatin dynamics and global transcriptional changes during the cell cycle in Sulfolobales."

    "content": "The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis has sparked renewed interest in using bacteriophage (phage) as a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Phage are viruses that infect and often kill bacteria, and have served as key models for many molecular biology studies. There are many complex phage-bacterial interactions that dictate the success or failure of the phage life cycle, but many of these are not well understood or characterised. These include the specific interactions to recognize a bacterium during the infection process, bacterial phage defence mechanisms and metabolic pathways that are key to phage replication. In this study a novel Escherichia coli phage, Arnold, is characterised and the genome sequence is reported. We then use transposon-directed insertion sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of E. coli mutants to identify over 200 genes involved in Arnold phage infection or in phage resistance. Using this approach, we identified both an outer membrane protein (BtuB, vitamin B12 transporter) and an inner membrane protein (SdaC, serine/proton symporter) involved in phage infection. Deletions in these genes were shown to provide immunity to infection by this phage. Understanding the genetic basis of phage infection and phage resistance should allow us to select or design phage to target specific bacterial pathogens in the future."

    "content": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum depends entirely on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, as it is unable to salvage these essential nucleotides. This reliance makes the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway a compelling target for antimalarial drugs, with several inhibitors targeting its rate-limiting enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), already in clinical development. In this study, we investigated the roles of three other pathway enzymes - aspartate transcarbamoylase (PfATC), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (PfCPSII), and dihydroorotase (PfDHO). PfATC features a unique N-terminal extension predicted to serve as an apicoplast trafficking peptide. However, using antibodies against the native protein and an epitope-tagged version, we found no evidence of apicoplast localization. Knockdown of PfATC expression proved lethal and could not be rescued by an apicoplast metabolic bypass. Complementation assays further revealed that truncation of the N-terminal domain impaired parasite growth, suggesting that this region is important for PfATC function or stability in vivo. PfCPSII, which harbors large Plasmodium-specific insertions between its catalytic domains, was likewise found to be essential for parasite proliferation. To assess the role of PfDHO, we engineered parasites to salvage uracil via heterologous expression of a yeast enzyme. Deletion of PfDHO in this parasite line resulted in uracil auxotrophy, confirming the enzyme's essential function in pyrimidine synthesis. Together, these findings reveal multiple vulnerable nodes within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway."

    "content": "When bacteriophages infect starved host bacteria, the restrictive host physiology may lead to prolonged latent periods and/or reduced burst sizes, compared to infection of a fast-growing bacterium. Using a mathematical model, we explore a system of two types of virulent phages that have distinct host physiology dependencies and are infecting a shared bacterial host population. We consider different environmental regimes to test whether they can compete and coexist under fluctuating conditions, putting emphasis on phases with limited resources for bacterial growth. We find that phages capable of delaying lysis in response to nutrient limitations can outcompete fast-replicating phages in feast-famine environments. This advantage mainly stems from increased mortality of free phages due to abortive adsorption to already infected hosts during starvation phases. We identify specific system dynamics that either support or suppress the propagation of the delayed lysis phage. This theoretical analysis highlights the competitive benefits and the limitations of delayed lysis as a phage propagation strategy. Our results underscore importance of considering the bacterial physiology dependence of bacteriophage replication in order to correctly predict phage fitness and population dynamics in complex environments."

    "content": "Microbial sulfate reduction is a cornerstone of marine sediment biogeochemistry, driving carbon remineralization and fueling the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Yet in zones of high methane flux, sulfate limitations may constrain the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that typically perform AOM. Although often overlooked, sulfur redox intermediates are readily utilized by diverse microorganisms, potentially driving AOM in sulfate-limited zones. To resolve the microbial mechanisms underlying cryptic sulfur cycling in such sediments, Monterey Canyon cold methane seeps were investigated through an integrated geochemical, isotopic, and metatranscriptomic approach. High-resolution electrochemical measurements confirmed intense sulfide production in seep sites, and long-term anoxic incubations were conducted with sediment from the SMTZ amended with elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or sulfate as the sole sulfur source, with or without methane. Over 650 days, sulfide accumulation was greatest in elemental sulfur treatments, followed by thiosulfate and sulfate; in all cases methane addition enhanced sulfide production. Isotopic measurements showed modest S-isotope fractionation indicating that the large fractionations typical of slow sulfate reduction were muted by additional sulfur transformations. In elemental sulfur treatments, isotopic and geochemical patterns suggested that disproportionation was unlikely. Metatranscriptomes revealed broad expression of sox genes and abundant dsr/apr across treatments, along with thiosulfate-linked phs upregulation. While ANME-2c and SEEP-SRB2 activity increased with methane, transcriptomic and isotopic data together highlighted the roles of Desulfocapsaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Sulfurovaceae lineages in mediating sulfur transformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate how cryptic sulfur cycling may sustain microbial communities in sulfate-depleted deep-sea sediments and contribute to AOM."

ALAN increased M. aquaticum height and total biomass, but had no effect on native species growth. In feeding assays, P. canaliculata consumed all three native species but consistently avoided M. aquaticum under both light treatments. C. chinensis showed no feeding in no-choice assays, but in choice assays, consumed H. verticillata and M. spicatum under No-ALAN and only M. spicatum under ALAN. In community mesocosms, P. canaliculata reduced native macrophyte biomass by 48.0% under No-ALAN and 87.2% under ALAN without affecting M. aquaticum. This selective feeding increased M. aquaticum's proportional biomass, with a stronger effect under ALAN than No-ALAN. These results suggest that ALAN can indirectly facilitate non-native macrophyte invasion by amplifying their relative biomass within native communities, particularly in the presence of invasive herbivores, and may promote invasional meltdown through altered feeding preferences."

Peterson & Saarela (synonym Spartina anglica) is a highly invasive coastal weed that forms dense monocultures in intertidal mudflats and estuaries, displacing native reedbeds and associated fauna. Introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand from Britain in the early 1900s to aid coastal land reclamation, it became a conservation concern by the 1960s, prompting control efforts in the South Island from the 1970s. This study presents a detailed S. anglicus eradication case study from the Marlborough Sounds, where detections are nearing zero. We model changes in detection probability over time in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound, a complex estuarine catchment. We aim to inform control efforts and assess the effectiveness of ongoing management, by evaluating the probability of non-detection as a proxy for functional eradication. Using data from the Department of Conservation (DOC), we analysed detections across 79 search blocks between 2013 and 2024. A generalised linear mixed model was used to generate predicted detections through to 2040, using a modified dataset with pseudo-zero values for probable absences. The data were modelled as presence/absence with a binomial distribution, to identify the first year with a <0.01 probability of a positive detection (upper 99% confidence limit). Results suggest that by 2032, the likelihood of further detections under current management practices is remote, and that functional eradication may have occurred. We interpret this decline in detection probability as indicative of management success. Model outputs can support decision-making as to when active surveillance might reasonably be ceased. To accelerate the tail-end of eradication efforts, we recommend intensifying search effort and widening delimitations within the catchment over the next five years, to ensure removal of any remaining individuals. We also propose the use of environmental DNA as a cost-effective backstop for after operational wind-down."

    "content": "Climate warming is altering the timing of seasonal growth in cold-temperate and boreal ecosystems, with potential consequences for forests on multiple continents. It has been hypothesized that in a warming climate, earlier growth in spring might lead to a longer growing season and thus higher annual total growth. However, whether the period of active growth is longer in a warming climate is unclear, as is whether changes in growth rate might reinforce or offset the effect of changing growing season length in modulating annual total growth. Understanding responses in growth to warming is crucial to projecting forest dynamics under future climate change. To address this, we experimentally warmed (by +1.62 and 3.26 {degrees}C on average) open-air southern boreal forest plots for 14 years (2010 to 2023) and measured juvenile height growth from spring until fall for 20 tree and shrub species, with a total of 11,565 individual-year growth trajectories. Across all species and in various canopy (open, closed) and rainfall (ambient, reduced) contexts, experimental warming consistently advanced the timing of height growth (4.32 days per 3 {degrees}C warming). However, species differed in their annual total growth responses. Evergreen gymnosperms such as spruce, fir, and pine tended to exhibit suppressed annual total growth under warming (-15.8% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by a shorter duration of active growth, despite an earlier start, with little change in relative growth rate. In contrast, deciduous angiosperms and non-native shrubs often show enhanced annual total growth under warming (19.3 and 37.4% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by faster rate, longer duration, or a combination of both. More broadly, species with a more conservative lifestyle responded less positively in the duration and rate of growth, thus placing them at a disadvantage under warming. These contrasting responses challenge assumptions that an earlier start of the growing season universally enhances growth and highlight how warming may shift both the timing and pace of growth and thus alter community composition within mixed-species forests."

    "content": "The location at which a species assemblage is observed can be uncertain, for example in fisheries where catch composition is recorded accurately but location data may be coarse or inaccurate. In such cases, spatial signals in observed species compositions can help identify and refine uncertain locations. This study explored three approaches for location estimation using species composition data: 1) a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that jointly estimates species distributions and location uncertainty, 2) an inverse prediction method that uses a fitted SDM to identify the most likely location given new species data, and 3) the direct modeling of location as the response variable. Each approach requires a subset of observations with accurate locations to quantify the spatial patterns in species distributions. All three methods were useful and reasonably accurate: for the simulated data the average distance error (distance to true location) was 15% the size of the domain, and for the real data this error was 20-100 km. When only some locations are uncertain, the hierarchical approach is valuable due to its integrated estimation of location and species parameters. When many locations are uncertain, the other approaches seem more suitable. Inverse prediction is ideal when prior information is available to constrain the location estimation. Direct modelling (although causally spurious) is well suited to large datasets, with multivariate random forests often providing the most accurate location estimates. These methods can enhance spatial data quality in ecological monitoring and help develop tools for improving inaccurate or deliberately misreported fishing locations."

Here, we provide direct evidence for active anaerobic metabolism in the GVC by measuring hydrogen (H2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) production, indicative of microbial fermentation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification. Changes in GVC H2 concentrations after feeding suggest that feeding modulates substrate availability, which in turn influences microbial activity in this compartment. In bleached corals, the GVC remained consistently hypoxic and acidic, and anaerobic metabolic processes persisted across the diel cycle. These patterns suggest a shift in energy and nutrient cycling pathways within the bleached coral holobiont. Together, our findings identify the GVC as a dynamic site of microbial activity that may play an important role in holobiont carbon and nitrogen cycling, with potential implications for nutrient balance and coral resilience."

    "content": "1. Microclimates are critical for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behaviour, physiology, and species distributions. However, traditional physical heat-balance models for predicting ground temperatures in microhabitats often exhibit biases due to unaccounted environmental complexities and poorly constrained parameters. These limitations can hinder ecological research and conservation planning, particularly in the context of climate change. 2. In this study, we demonstrate how high-resolution drone-based mapping and machine learning can improve the accuracy of microclimate models. Using drone imagery, we generated detailed environmental maps, including solar radiation, vegetation indices, and skyview factors, to parameterize a physical heat-balance model. Validation with thermal maps derived from drone-mounted infrared cameras revealed systematic errors in the physical model's predictions, including over- and underestimations under specific environmental conditions. To address these errors, we applied a random forest machine learning model to predict and correct biases in new prediction maps. 3. Our results show that machine learning reduced mean absolute errors by over 30% and mean square errors by 50%, while consistently narrowing the range of prediction inaccuracies. Key factors driving biases, such as vegetation cover, solar radiation, and height above ground, were identified, offering valuable insights for improving physical models. The machine learning corrections not only improved accuracy but also highlighted parameters and processes that were previously underrepresented or oversimplified in traditional models. 4. These findings illustrate the potential of ML to improve microclimate predictions. While our drone-based approach is most applicable to open, sparsely vegetated habitats, the principle of ML bias correction can be extended to other systems as well. Correcting microclimate models with ML and observational data provides ecologists and conservation practitioners with a powerful framework for generating more accurate microclimate estimates. Such improvements deepen our understanding of species' responses to climate change and support climate-resilient management strategies."

    "content": "The malarial parasite emph{Plasmodium vivax} has infected humans for millennia. As such, alleles like the FY*O allele in the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and the sickle cell allele (HbS) have been naturally selected for in malaria-endemic regions because they confer resistance to malaria, thereby increasing the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying these protective alleles. As resistance becomes more common in a population, malaria incidence is expected to decline, reducing the evolutionary pressure for additional resistance. In this work, we explore the interaction between these processes. We construct a model with seasonality that tracks the frequency of Duffy genotypes and leverages fast/slow dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamics of malaria transmission and changes in the gene frequency of the DARC genotype. Specifically, we investigate how the burden of malaria changes with the fractions of people with the various DARC genotypes. We derive the basic reproduction number as the threshold condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and interpret the $R_0$ as a weighted sum of the cases generated by infected individuals of each genotype. Additionally, we calibrate our model using data from the Amazonas region in Brazil, which has a polymorphic population with respect to DARC, and still reports a substantial number of emph{P. vivax} cases. Analysis of our model determines the proportion of the population that must be Duffy-negative in order for the entire population to be protected against emph{P. vivax} without any further interventions. Furthermore, we assess how different proportions of Duffy-negative individuals influence the monthly incidence of emph{P. vivax} cases."

    "content": "Understanding the cascading effects of forest decline on saproxylic communities is fundamental for optimizing the management of disturbed forests toward biodiversity conservation objectives. We postulated that the nature and intensity of cascading pathways would vary along decline gradients, encompassing stages from stand decline to mortality and subsequent salvage logging, as mediated by shifts in habitat conditions and resource availability. This study was conducted across three representative European forest contexts: fir forests in the French Pyrenees, spruce forests in Bavaria (Germany), and oak forests in the lowlands of the Loire Valley (France). Within these systems, we assessed how the taxonomic and functional -diversity of saproxylic beetles responded to variations in both the diversity and density of deadwood and tree-related microhabitats (TreMs). Our analyses identified key cascading effects of stand decline and mortality that were shaped by the considered beetle guild and by the forest type, reflecting tree species-specific disturbance legacies. Stand decline and mortality produced distinct responses within saproxylic beetle assemblages, as different successional guilds preferentially utilized either dying or dead trees. The overall influence of decline processes was positive in conifer-dominated forests. TreMs played a central role in mediating cascading processes structuring saproxylic beetle communities throughout the forest decline continuum. The increase in TreM heterogeneity associated with stand decline or mortality enhanced saproxylic diversity, with exposed wood and trunk injuries identified as particularly influential microhabitats. Snags and large deadwood elements, especially in spruce forests, and deadwood diversity further contributed to sustaining high levels of beetle diversity. Conversely, salvage logging exerted detrimental effects on numerous guilds, primarily through reductions in TreM diversity, decreased TreM trait dispersion, and the depletion of saproxylic TreMs. Given the pronounced context dependency of the processes driving these cascading community dynamics, and considering the increasing frequency, severity, and spatial extent of forest disturbances and global forest decline, it is imperative to integrate this complexity into management and conservation frameworks. Addressing these mechanisms with greater precision will be critical for maintaining functional biodiversity within rapidly changing forest ecosystems."

Natural history museums can enhance the study of zoonoses by serving as valuable resources for understanding the ecology and evolutionary history of pathogens and their wildlife hosts. Despite the growing interest in the role museums can play in pathobiology research and zoonotic risk assessment, there remains a lack of centralized resources for locating tissue samples that may be leveraged for pathogen discovery. Using the worlds most significant global aggregator of museum specimens, The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we examined how such tools could be adopted to identify specimens that might be sources of viral genetic material. Focusing on tissue samples from the mammalian orders Rodentia and Chiroptera, speciose taxa that host a high diversity of known zoonotic viruses, we examined temporal, spatial, and taxonomic gaps and patterns in the available tissue samples. Our analyses reveal a heavy bias toward tissue samples collected from the Americas (and consequently, taxonomic groups found in the Americas), with most collected samples housed in North American institutions. This limits the scope of future pathogen discovery efforts and presents a barrier to pandemic preparedness in the Global South. We also examine gaps in metadata quality (e.g., descriptions of preservation method and storage medium) and outline recommendations for GBIF to facilitate future biosurveillance projects and effectively incorporate natural history museums into One Health disease research."

    "content": "Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an invasive parasitic nematode and zoonotic pathogen responsible for eosinophilic meningitis. Originally native to Southeast Asia, it is now globally distributed across tropical and subtropical regions and is approaching Europe, with Tenerife as a key hotspot. This study investigates the distribution and prevalence of A. cantonensis in Tenerife across three host groups (rats, gastropods, lizards). Based on prevalence data, we modelled its potential distribution using species distribution models (SDMs) and compared climatic conditions with Hawaii, a region with frequent human cases. Field surveys confirmed A. cantonensis in endemic and introduced gastropods (25.6%; 179/698), rats (21.5%; 14/79), and lizards (24.0%; 31/129), with local prevalence ranging from 2.4% to 41.6%. MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree models identified precipitation seasonality as the main driver of distribution, while prevalence was influenced primarily by tree cover density and climatic variability. Northeastern Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro showed the highest habitat suitability. However, overlap with densely populated areas was limited, possibly explaining the absence of reported human cases. The MESS analysis, based on climatic data from Hawaii, indicated moderate to high environmental similarity across most of the Canary Islands, except in northeastern Tenerife, where conditions were outside the range observed in Hawaii. A. cantonensis is firmly established in Tenerife, but human cases remain absent, likely due to limited human exposure, cultural practices, and geographic separation of parasite hotspots from urban zones. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating ecological and epidemiological data in zoonotic risk assessments."

    "content": "Species interactions are fundamental to maintaining biodiversity. However, how these interactions change over time in response to varying climatic conditions has been poorly explored. This gap limits our ability to identify how temporal changes in coexistence mechanisms sustain diverse communities. Here, we present a modeling approach, coupled with theory, to evaluate how temporal changes in species competitive and mutualistic interactions and intrinsic growth rates promote structural stability. We illustrate our framework using two highly replicated yet independent datasets: (1) annual plant grasslands and (2) wild bee assemblages in shrublands, both subjected to the same variation in rainfall over nine years. We found that both systems respond similarly to year-to-year rainfall changes despite their disparate evolutionary backgrounds. While rainfall variability fosters more diverse communities, prolonged drought leads to substantial biodiversity loss. Although the spatial context dependency modifies some responses, the structural stability of most communities persists through time, with clear winners and losers emerging under environmental variability. The main underlying mechanism determining the observed community stability is a combination of species-specific changes in their growth rates, an increase in the variability of interspecific interactions, and a reduction in the strength of self-limiting effects. Our results underscore the need to consider time-varying species interactions to understand community stability under contrasting climatic conditions and to predict how climate severity influences biodiversity loss."

Our analyses of those data quantified the benefits of spatial fishery closures, known as Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs), on 28 species of groundfish occupying a wide range of distances from RCAs (inside RCAs to {approx}150 km away). On average, body sizes and relative abundance increased by 1.1% and 11.0%, respectively, per 5 km-increase in RCA proximity. Variation around these average responses depended on the species' life history characteristics, RCA location, and historical impacts from commercial fishing. Additionally, the benefits of spatial protection increased with time since RCA implementation."

Manual annotations and basic thresholding method were used to quantify detection success. Results showed that detection rates were highest when surveys were conducted under cooler ambient temperatures and at moderate altitudes (e.g. 60 metres AGL) with 50% image overlap.

Composed of both bacteria and protists, biofilm communities are shaped by environmental conditions and the lifestyle traits of their constituent organisms. Although biofilm and planktonic communities may share some taxa, the extent of the overlap and the factors driving community differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial and protist communities associated with Phragmites australis stem biofilms and planktonic fractions across five lakes spanning an eutrophication gradient in the Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland. The biofilm communities on reed stems were highly distinct from planktonic ones, sharing only a small core microbiome. The biofilm core not only exceeded that of planktonic communities but also contained characteristic taxa, identified via machine learning, that were distinct from planktonic assemblages, including several with potential roles in bioremediation and as bioindicators. Planktonic communities were strongly influenced by environmental factors, whereas Phragmites australis-associated epiphytic biofilm communities appeared more uniform across lakes, consistent with host-associated selection and potentially with lifestyle-related buffering. Moreover, biofilm suspensions exhibited higher apparent physiological activity per inoculum volume and broader substrate use under our assay conditions than the free-living communities. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the ecological significance of biofilms in freshwater systems and underscore the need to integrate both biofilm and planktonic fractions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to fully capture microbial diversity, function, and ecosystem resilience."

Here, we investigated which functional species traits (scale type, schooling behaviour, and position-in-water-column) are selected for by eDNA metabarcoding and beach seines in nearshore eelgrass, mixed eelgrass, and understory kelp habitats. Using data from 35 sites across southeast Alaska, we applied occupancy modeling to estimate detection of species traits by each gear type. Detection probability with eDNA was 27 times greater for species with deciduous scales compared to species with non-deciduous scales, and lower for species with plates (rather than scales). Conversely, species with plates showed greater odds of detection with beach seines. Given the novelty of eDNA sampling, quantifying interactions between functional traits and gear selectivity will be important to accurately characterize species distributions across marine habitats."

Here, we present an extensive field-based study of small mammals and their multiple pathogens to assess diversity-disease relationships at a local scale, revealing pathogen-specific patterns. While no significant association was detected between the prevalence of some pathogens and host diversity, others such as Orthopoxvirus and a strain of Mycoplasma haemomuris exhibited dilution effect patterns, whereas another Mycoplasma haemomuris strain and Mycoplasma coccoides displayed amplification effects. Crucially, we demonstrate that these contrasting outcomes are consistently explained by the host competence-abundance relationship. Our findings underscore the importance of host community composition and highlight the need to consider multiple pathogens when evaluating the ecological mechanisms underpinning the diversity-disease relationships."

Among the most affected habitats are coastal communities, which host many endemic taxa and provide valuable ecosystem services. One such invasive taxa is Kalanchoe xhoughtonii, an allegedly artificial hybrid. This plant, although having demonstrated strong invasive potential, still largely remains unrecognised as a taxon of concern in Mediterranean countries, at least in national official catalogues. In this study, we assess the impact of this hybrid on coastal communities, focusing on the European Union Habitat of Community Interest (HCI) 1240--''vegetated cliffs with endemic statices (Limonium spp.)''--at two sites along the southern coast of Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). Between 2022 and 2025, we conducted field surveys to document the population size, growth stages, and spatial competition with native species. Additionally, we gathered 1,422 iNaturalist occurrences of K. xhoughtonii to map its distribution across the Mediterranean Basin, assess its presence within Natura 2000 protected sites and within protected areas, including the HCI 1240, and determine its potential spread using ensemble ecological niche modelling with bioclimatic variables. Our results show that K. xhoughtonii forms dense monospecific patches in the surveyed areas that compete for space with two native Limonium species in southern Catalonia. Moreover, we confirmed 713 naturalised occurrences in the Mediterranean area, 107 were located within Natura 2000 protected sites and 58 within the HCI 1240 included in protected sites. Ecological niche modelling indicates high climatic suitability across 93% of western and 59% of eastern Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites containing the HCI 1240. The findings of this study highlight the invasive potential of K. xhoughtonii and support its inclusion in national catalogues of invasive species across Mediterranean basin countries. The study calls for systematic monitoring of the spread and ecological impact of this hybrid species in coastal community habitats."

Here, we design an activatable trident-like fluorescent peptide probe (RMN) to bind with the ovarian tumor-overexpressed N-cadherin and respond to the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Here, we developed a method to identify B cell epitopes by characterizing &gt;437,000 peptides tested for IgG binding and &gt;370 million B cell receptor (BCR) clones. Our single-cell BCR sequencing of pre\u2013 and post\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination validates the performance of this method. Mouse vaccination experiments demonstrate that B cell neoepitopes enhance immune responses, driving BCR expansion and tumor regression. Genomic analysis of &gt;8000 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples reveals an inverse correlation between predicted B cell reactivity and mutation allele frequencies, indicating B cell\u2013mediated neoantigen elimination. Applying our multiomics model to checkpoint blockade responses in 2074 patients highlights the clinical relevance of B cell neoepitope prediction. A meta-analysis of 11 personalized vaccine trials involving 1739 neoantigens suggests that incorporating B cell neoepitopes may improve vaccination efficacy. These results underscore the significance of B cell\u2013reactive neoantigens in antitumor immunity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

This process involves system- and synaptic-level changes and predominantly occurs during sleep. While hippocampal-cortical circuits are well studied in this context, the contributions of other systems, including dopaminergic circuits\u2014key players in learning-related processes\u2014remain poorly understood. Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    ) neurons are active during sleep and suggested to participate in memory consolidation processes; however, causal evidence for this is lacking. Using calcium-dependent fiber photometry, electrophysiology, and chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations across learning paradigms, we explore the functions of VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    neuronal activity during sleep. We show that VTA\n    <sup>\n     DA\n    </sup>\n    activity during nonrapid eye movement sleep is experience dependent, is enhanced by motor skill and associative learning, facilitates motor skill memory consolidation, and exhibits a motor learning\u2013dependent increase in temporal coordination with cortical spindle oscillations.

The pathophysiology underlying LID is poorly understood, and treatment options are limited. To move toward filling this treatment gap, the intrinsic and synaptic changes in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) triggered by the sustained elevation of dopamine (DA) during dyskinesia were characterized using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular, and behavioral approaches. Our studies revealed that the intrinsic excitability and functional corticostriatal connectivity of SPNs in dyskinetic mice oscillate between LID on- and off-states in a cell- and state-specific manner. Although triggered by levodopa, these oscillations in SPN properties depended on both dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling. Disrupting M1 muscarinic receptor signaling specifically in indirect pathway SPNs or deleting its downstream signaling partner CalDAG-GEFI blunted the levodopa-induced alterations in functional connectivity, enhanced the motoric benefits of levodopa, and attenuated LID severity.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

X-ray crystallography can reveal these changes in atomic detail, but standard analysis methods, which refine separate datasets, often overlook differences that are subtle or arise in only a subset of molecules. Direct comparison of crystallographic datasets is, in principle, more powerful, but systematic errors (\u201cscales\u201d) often mask changes in the crystallographic observables (\u201cstructure factors\u201d). Machine learning algorithms that jointly estimate scales and structure factors can address this limitation. Here, we augment this approach with multivariate, structured priors derived from crystallographic theory, implemented in the variational deep learning framework Careless. Doing so strongly improves the detection of protein dynamics, element-specific anomalous signals, and the binding of drug candidates, offering a robust approach to comparative crystallography and, potentially, to detection of protein dynamics by other structure determination methods.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

Thirty-two isolates were assigned to the same species with all four assembly-based classifiers, while the remaining 25 showed diverging assignments. When evaluating the results for the latter isolates, GTDB-Tk performed better than the other classifiers regarding which assignments were most likely correct. Of the read-based classifiers, MetaPhlAn4 performed better than Kraken2. Our evaluation identified GTDB-Tk to be the strongest tool for taxonomic assignment of isolates that are difficult to identify. Disagreements between classifiers are likely due to database limitations, wrongly assigned taxonomy, or unreliable 16S rRNA gene-based assignments.</span>"

Hence, methodological variations related to the separation of extracellular and intracellular DNA can severely distort the outcome of eDNA\u2010based studies.\n\nABSTRACT\nGetting insights into the quantitative and qualitative contribution of different DNA states, i.e., extracellular (exDNA) and intracellular DNA (iDNA), to the total environmental DNA (eDNA) pool requires reliable methods for their separation. Even though a multitude of respective extraction protocols has been published, their validation is often missing. Here, we selected four protocols for the state\u2010specific extraction of eDNA and traced the separation of exDNA and iDNA within natural environments using previously designed spike\u2010and\u2010recovery controls. Besides accounting for the different eDNA states, the spike\u2010ins also distinguished different bacterial origins (gram\u2010positive, gram\u2010negative). Following their quantification by digital PCR, the recovery of exDNA and iDNA spike\u2010ins in both the target as well as nontarget eDNA states differed among the selected extraction protocols and environmental matrices, albeit the effect of the former was far more decisive. While the recovery of exDNA spike\u2010ins was mainly affected by the chemical composition of the washing buffer and the duration of each washing step, the lysis method determined the recovery of spiked iDNA. These aspects were further combined within an optimised protocol, providing a valuable step towards a more concise understanding of factors governing the state\u2010specific extraction of eDNA and hence their relevance in molecular microbial ecology."

    "content": "Abstract\nA significant quantity of soil organic carbon (SOC) is buried in mangrove ecosystems. However, recent research has revealed that substantial amounts of carbon are exported to the atmosphere as CO2 or to the ocean as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC). This carbon outflow highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of carbon burial, outgassing, and outwelling to clarify the role of mangroves in net atmospheric CO2 removal. To elucidate the carbon cycle within a mangrove ecosystem, we quantified CO2 outgassing through high\u2010resolution measurements CO2 and porewater\u2010derived fluxes of total alkalinity, DIC, DOC, and POC using radium isotopes (224Ra and 223Ra) in an island mangrove ecosystem in Japan. Our findings showed that the dominant carbon flux was DIC outwelling, at 189\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0mmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0day\u22121, approximately 2.3 times higher than the global median. This pronounced DIC outwelling likely reflects the presence of a vast reservoir of poorly stabilized SOC. A comparison with ecosystem\u2010scale CO2 emissions revealed that approximately 89% of the DIC was transported into the estuary without being emitted as CO2. This high DIC transport appears to result from the efficient water exchange characteristic of island mangroves, with a creek residence time of \u223c1\u00a0day. Surprisingly, the adjacent estuary acted as a net CO2 sink, surpassing CO2 outgassing from the mangrove creeks. These results suggest that efficient water exchange in island mangroves, coupled with high biological productivity at the adjacent estuary, promotes long\u2010term sequestration of mangrove\u2010derived DIC in the ocean."

Combining modeling and experiments on Daphnia, we show that food quality, quantity and thermal variability jointly constrain TSR expression, potentially leading to smaller yet older individuals at maturity.\n\nABSTRACT\nEctotherms tend to mature at smaller sizes as average temperatures rise, a pattern known as the Temperature\u2010Size Rule (TSR), which also predicts earlier age at maturity. However, in natural environments, warming is often accompanied by increased thermal variability and limited nutritional resources. Using a bioenergetic model combined with factorial growth experiments on Daphnia, we investigated how temperature, food concentration, and food quality (Polyunsaturated fatty acid and sterol content) jointly shape size and age at maturity. We find that poor food quality narrows the upper thermal limit for TSR expression, while low food quantity restricts both upper and lower thermal bounds. Increased thermal variability shifts this range towards cooler temperatures. These findings suggest that the TSR may not hold under ecologically realistic conditions, especially when organisms are close to their thermal optimum where small concomitant increases of resource limitation and temperature variability with warming may lead to smaller yet older individuals at maturity."

    "content": "<p>by Assaf Biran, Yaron E. Antebi</p>\n\nSignaling pathways enable cells to coordinate collective behaviors by exchanging specific information. Many pathways utilize multiple ligand variants to activate the same intracellular signaling cascade, raising the question of how cells discriminate between these seemingly redundant signals. It has been shown that individual cells can discriminate between signals based on their induced level of activity, temporal dynamics or combinatorial effect. Here, we demonstrate that ligand discrimination could also emerge at the population level. Using mathematical models of ligand-receptor interactions, we examine how response heterogeneity at the population level can encode ligand identity. We introduce a local scaling metric to quantify how variation in pathway components affects the cellular response. Our results reveal that for pathways with dimeric receptors, and more significantly for heterodimeric receptors, biochemical parameters of the ligands control the resulting heterogeneity in the response of a population of cells. Furthermore, we show that the population-level heterogeneity encodes the enzymatic activity of the resulting receptor complex. This suggests a functional advantage for utilizing heterodimeric receptor complexes in pathways acting across a population of cells, such as the type I interferon pathway, which shows several of the characteristics of our model. This contrasts to juxtacrine pathways, such as Notch, that do not act at the population level and use a single component receptor. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which receptor architecture enables cells to encode ligand-specific information through population-level heterogeneity, offering insights into immune regulation, tissue development, and synthetic biology."

    "content": "<p>by Jakub L\u00e1la, Ayham Al-Saffar, Stefano Angioletti-Uberti</p>\n\nDespite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics."

    "content": "<p>by Leonardo Agasso, Ivan Molineris, Michele Caselle</p>\n\nTwo rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred about 500 million years ago and played a major role in the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Human genes derived from WGD are called \u201cohnologs\u201d. Ohnologs are involved in fundamental biological processes and significantly contributed to the complexity of the human gene regulatory network. Given the central role of miRNAs in gene regulation, we investigated the contribution of ohnolog miRNAs (ohno-miRNAs) to the human gene regulatory network. We identified intragenic ohno-miRNAs as having higher retention rates compared to intragenic Small Scale Duplicated (SSD) miRNAs. Ohno-miRNAs also show high sequence similarity, a stronger tendency to regulate common target genes and are typically more expressed compared to miRNAs unrelated to WGD events. Analyzing the role of ohno-miRNAs in the human gene regulatory network, we showed that ohno-miRNAs are statistically overrepresented in specific network motifs commonly associated with redundancy and complexity, highlighting their central role in gene regulation."

Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages which is prone to induce delays and biases. More recently, several authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most existing methods are either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. The analysis of wastewater samples has recently been pointed out as a valuable complementary approach to clinical sample analysis, however the pooled nature of the data involves specific statistical challenges. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations in a consistent way with lineages B.1.160, Alpha, B.1.177, Beta, and with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods (which track specific mutations over time) with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations."

    "content": "<p>by Michael P. Mustri, Quqiming Duan, Samraat Pawar</p>\n\nThe generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology for modeling the dynamics emerging from species interactions within complex ecological communities. The GLV is also increasingly being used to infer species interactions and predict dynamics from empirical data on microbial communities, in particular. However, despite its widespread use, the accuracy of the GLV\u2019s pairwise interaction structure in capturing the unseen dynamics of microbial consumer-resource interactions\u2014arising from resource competition and metabolite exchanges\u2014remains unclear. Here, we rigorously quantify how well the GLV can represent the dynamics of a general mathematical model that encapsulates key consumer-resource processes in microbial communities. We find that the GLV significantly misrepresents the feasibility, stability, and reactivity of microbial communities above a threshold biologically feasible level of consumer-resource coupling, because it omits higher-order nonlinear interactions. We show that the probability of the GLV making inaccurate predictions can be quantified by a simple, empirically accessible measure of timescale separation between consumers and resources. These insights advance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of resource-mediated microbial interactions and provide a method for gauging the GLV\u2019s reliability across various empirical and theoretical scenarios."

    "content": "<p>by Monica Sacco, Stefano Lancellotti, Antonietta Ferretti, Maria Basso, Leonardo Di Gennaro, Giancarlo Castaman, Raimondo De Cristofaro</p>\n\nType 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is often caused by variants in von Willebrand factor (VWF), including p.R1205H (\u201cVicenza mutation\u201d), which accelerate VWF clearance via macrophage receptor LRP1 and impair platelet adhesion and activation. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain partially unclear. Here, we use integrative computational modeling (I-TASSER, HADDOCK2.4, and PRODIGY) to predict how p.R1205H/C/L/S variants alter VWF interaction with LRP1 and its platelet receptor GPIb\u03b1 that binds to the A1 VWF domain. Our models reveal that R1205 acts as a structural hinge: its variants disrupt polar networks in VWF\u2019s D3 domain, exposing neo-epitopes that enhance LRP1 binding (\u0394\u0394G up to \u22125.3 kcal/mol) while destabilizing the A1 domain\u2019s \u03b11-\u03b22 loop, reducing GPIb\u03b1 affinity (\u224530-fold for R1205L/C). These findings explain clinical observations, p.R1205H rapid clearance yet retained platelet adhesion, and establish R1205 as a dual-functional switch regulating VWF circulatory lifetime and hemostatic activity. This analytical procedure provides a template for predicting pathogenicity of VWF variants and designing targeted therapies for VWD."

Recent studies have revealed the presence of distinct chromatin subcompartments beyond the traditional A/B compartments (eu- and hetero-chromatin), each exhibiting unique structural and functional properties. Here, we introduce TECSAS (Transformer of Epigenetics to Chromatin Structural AnnotationS), a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, designed to predict chromatin subcompartment annotations directly from epigenomic data. TECSAS leverages information from histone modifications, transcription factor binding profiles, and RNA-Seq data to decode the relationship between the biochemical composition of chromatin and its 3D structural behavior. TECSAS achieves high accuracy in predicting subcompartment annotations and reveals the influence of long-range epigenomic context on chromatin organization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to predict the association of loci with nuclear bodies, such as the lamina, nucleoli, and speckles, providing insights into the role of these structures in shaping the 3D genome organization. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models for deciphering the complex interplay between epigenomic features and 3D genome organization, allowing us to better understand genome structure and function."

Despite this, we know very little about this major group of eukaryotes. To establish a model organism for comprehensive investigation, we performed subcellular proteomics on <i>Paradiplonema papillatum</i> and localized 4,870 proteins to 22 cellular compartments. We additionally confirmed the predicted location of several proteins by epitope tagging and fluorescence microscopy. To probe the metabolic capacities of <i>P. papillatum</i>, we explored the proteins predicted to the cell membrane compartment in our subcellular proteomics dataset. Our data revealed an accumulation of many carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CDZymes). Our predictions suggest that these CDZymes are exposed to extracellular space, supporting proposals that diplonemids may specialize in breaking down carbohydrates in plant and algal cell walls. Further exploration of carbohydrate metabolism revealed an evolutionary divergence in the function of glycosomes (modified peroxisomes) in diplonemids versus kinetoplastids. Our subcellular proteome provides a resource for future investigations into the unique cell biology of diplonemids."

    "content": "The evolution of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signaling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity could also come with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell\u2019s baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviorally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies that may allow cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump\u2019s electrogenicity can open an additional axis of vulnerability that may play a role in brain disease."

    "content": "Daily choices are often influenced by environmental cues that are not directly associated with reinforcers. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be studied using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm involves the repeated pairing of two innocuous stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase in which one stimulus is associated with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The result is a conditioned response (e.g., freezing) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we successfully established a light\u2013tone sensory preconditioning task specifically in male mice, as sex differences were observed in both control experimental groups and in sensory preconditioning responses. We employed in vivo, freely moving fiber photometry to monitor neural activity in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus in male mice during the formation of associations between innocuous stimuli and reinforcers. Additionally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to investigate the roles of these hippocampal subregions in sensory preconditioning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive neurons are involved in encoding innocuous stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we developed a novel light\u2013tone sensory preconditioning protocol in male mice, enabling the detection of sex differences and furthering our understanding of how specific hippocampal subregions and cell types regulate complex cognitive processes."

    "content": "Abstract\nObservations show a fragile linear relationship between South Asian monsoon rainfall and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), reflecting their complex interactions. Our analysis reveals that both extreme positive and negative IOD (EXpIOD/EXnIOD) events could enhance rainfall over western South Asia during August\u2013September, even when ENSO signals are removed. This asymmetric influence arises from moisture convergence driven by anomalous winds. AGCM simulations indicate that EXpIOD\u2010related suppressed convection over the eastern pole induces a westward\u2010extended Gill\u2010type anticyclone, whose southwesterlies reinforce the background monsoon and promote orographic rainfall near the Western Ghats. Contrastingly, EXnIOD features an eastward\u2010shifted dipole; positive convection in the east drives a cyclonic circulation that transports Bay of Bengal moisture westward. This flow converges with cross\u2010equatorial southwesterlies generated by the western pole, enhancing rainfall over western India. These results suggest that the pattern asymmetry between EXpIOD and EXnIOD is a key factor that deserves consideration when assessing IOD\u2010monsoon interactions."

Solar\u2010induced fluorescence (SIF) is an increasingly well\u2010known and reliable indicator of vegetation health which captures rapid changes in how plants absorb and use light under stress. Recent efforts leveraging machine learning trained on spaceborne SIF and vegetation data from other sensors are producing seamless maps of SIF at spatial resolutions (\u223c5\u00a0km) aligned with land management needs. Three recent studies, Mohammadi et\u00a0al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2202767119), Parazoo et\u00a0al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108310), and Behera et\u00a0al.

This study investigates a barite BaSO4 $\\left(BaS{O}_{4}\\right)$ precipitation process that forms a thin, low\u2010permeability layer between parallel flows. Three\u2010dimensional core\u2010scale flooding experiments are conducted in Berea sandstone to induce internal transverse mixing and precipitation. X\u2010ray imaging, axial pressure drop observations, and core plugs extracted along the transverse direction characterize the spatial distribution of the precipitation and its effects on permeability. The transverse thickness of the resulting precipitation layer increases with axial (downstream) distance according to a (square\u2010root) power law. On the other hand, the reduction in (transverse) permeability within the precipitation layer is more severe near the injection sources. A high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional reactive transport model is reconciled with observations using an empirical porosity\u2010permeability relation. This understanding is foundational to furthering emerging methods for scale mitigation and the design of flow control strategies."

    "content": "Cell-cell communication networks govern tissue function in health and disease, but existing computational tools rely on static ligand-receptor databases and correlation-based analyses that cannot distinguish direct causal relationships from confounding or indirect associations. We introduce Cell-CLIP (Cellular Causal Learning and Inference Pipeline), a modular framework applying Pearl's causal discovery algorithms to infer directed cell program interaction networks from patient-level single-cell RNA-seq data. Cell-CLIP aggregates noisy single-cell expression into biologically interpretable cell program activity scores, then applies PC (constraint-based) and GES (score-based) causal discovery algorithms to learn directed acyclic graphs representing putative causal relationships. We applied Cell-CLIP to a 176-patient lung atlas (normal, COVID-19, adenocarcinoma) focusing on 14 universal cell programs active across all phenotypes. Hybrid consensus causal discovery (PC and GES union) identified 21 directed edges, yielding a sparse network (11.5% density) dominated by macrophage program hubs. Four edges discovered by both algorithms (Intersection consensus) agree with known biological knowledge, included well-validated biological mechanisms like: CD8/NK differentiation cascades, macrophage sensing-recruitment etc. Quantitative benchmarking against a 40-edge Pearson correlation baseline demonstrated Cell-CLIP's complementary advantages: while correlation showed low specificity (28% of edges truly causal) and sensitivity (52% recall of causal edges), Cell-CLIP achieved 100% specificity by eliminating spurious associations from confounding and indirect paths. Key methodological advances include: correction for confounding by rejecting spurious correlations, detection of masked direct effects via conditional independence testing, inference of causal directionality distinguishing sequential regulatory cascades from co-regulation, and generation of novel predictions for experimental validation. Cell-CLIP provides a hypothesis-generating framework for discovering candidate causal circuits in cell-cell communication that extends beyond correlation-based methods, though inferred relationships require experimental validation due to observational data limitations."

    "content": "The reliability of single-cell proteomics (SCP) is intrinsically linked to the fidelity of cell isolation; however, the identification of co-isolated cells (doublets or multiplets) remains a persistent challenge for single-cell (sc-) omics. While single-cell transcriptomics has established probabilistic frameworks for doublet detection, these methods are ill-suited for the sparser throughput of SCP datasets. This work presents scpImaging, a novel computational pipeline that repurposes the latent microscopy data routinely generated during cellenONE-based sample preparation to provide deterministic quality control (QC) and high-content phenotypic profiling. We demonstrate that standard proteomic quality metrics for SCP (e.g., peptide count, signal intensity) paradoxically favour retaining doublets. In contrast, scpImaging applies machine-learning-based cell segmentation (Cellpose-SAM) to identify and exclude these artefacts with high precision. Furthermore, the framework integrates morphological metrics generated using the open-source CellProfiler, with proteomic abundance data, enabling joint analysis that links cell shape and texture to molecular cell state. Provided as an open-source R package, scpImaging offers a scalable, automated solution for enhancing data integrity and adding a phenotypic dimension to SCP experiments without increasing experimental cost or complexity."

    "content": "Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are rapidly progressive and life-threatening diseases caused by diverse bacterial pathogens. While classical virulence factors such as toxins and secretion systems have been extensively characterized, the role of metabolic fitness in supporting bacterial survival within the nutrient-restricted host environment remains underexplored. Edwardsiella tarda, a human-pathogenic bacterium implicated in NSTIs, represents an emerging model for studying non-canonical pathogenic strategies. Here, we employed transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify genes critical for E. tarda survival in a murine soft tissue infection model. A genome-wide screen revealed 41 genes significantly depleted during the infection, including those involved in iron and zinc acquisition (fetB, zupT), vitamin biosynthesis (pdxK, cobA), and polyamine metabolism (speB). Functional assays using defined minimal media demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin B6 or putrescine enhanced bacterial growth, validating their contribution to fitness under nutrient-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that E. tarda pathogenesis is driven not solely by classical virulence factors but also by its ability to acquire essential nutrients and adapt metabolically to host-imposed nutritional stress. This study provides the first genome-wide fitness map for E. tarda during soft tissue infection and reveals new targets for therapeutic intervention that disrupt nutrient acquisition systems. These results also emphasize the broader relevance of metabolic adaptation as a determinant of virulence in invasive bacterial infections."

    "content": "Warming temperatures are accelerating permafrost thaw and changing tundra vegetation, where woody shrubs are displacing sedges. Shrubs, such as Betula nana, and sedges, such as Eriophorum vaginatum, exhibit distinct life strategies including unique root-associated, or rhizosphere microbial communities. As permafrost thaws it unlocks previously unavailable carbon and nutrient sources resulting in deeper roots and a translocation of rhizosphere communities. Because permafrost microbial communities contain lower diversity and biomass than rhizosphere communities, the coalescence of rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities could alter soil organic matter (SOM) degradation rates and increase greenhouse gas emissions. To identify metabolic strategies across distinct rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities we conducted an isotope tracing incubation experiment. We inoculated thawed permafrost with shrub and sedge rhizosphere communities while adding exudates or water daily and compared this to an uninoculated control. After 46 days, we spiked samples with 18O enriched water or 13C enriched exudates and measured isotope incorporation into microbial DNA with quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). Our results indicate that exudate additions had little effect on uninoculated permafrost communities but the addition of exudates and rhizosphere inoculants had a compounding effect on respiration rates. We found that soils inoculated with shrub rhizosphere communities contained a mixture of exudate and SOM degraders while soils inoculated with sedge rhizosphere communities contained mainly SOM degraders. Finally, we found that individual microbial taxa exhibited maximum growth rates in one environment, which was a combination of microbial inoculant communities and exudate addition treatments. Our results reveal that microbial niches are strongly influenced by substrate preferences and community context, and suggest that a reduction in sedges and an expansion of shrubs may provide a mechanism by which permafrost carbon losses are mitigated through corresponding shifts in microbial communities and their substrate preferences."

Mutualism breakdown is a pressing challenge to examine this intersection, as shifts in diverse microbial communities might coincide with evolutionary changes in mutualistic traits within a key species. Here we study the legume-rhizobium mutualism after 33 years of nitrogen fertilization. Pairing manipulative inoculation studies with long-read amplicon sequencing provides unprecedented resolution across biological scales: whole bacterial community, genus Rhizobium, individual Rhizobium ASVs, and symbiosis plasmids. Clover host plants in N-fertilized plots encounter microbial communities depauperate in their preferred symbiont but enriched in other Rhizobium taxa; moreover, their symbiotic nodules house low-quality symbiosis plasmids. Thus, concurrent ecological and evolutionary shifts make mutualists both rarer and inferior and feed back to decrease the benefits hosts receive from mutualism."

Within the mosquito midgut, malaria parasite gametes are activated and undergo fertilisation. If parasite fertilisation is perturbed, this stops the transmission of malaria parasites from mosquito to human. One proposed target of transmission-blocking interventions is Plasmodium falciparum fusogen PfHAP2, which is essential for gamete fusion during parasite fertilisation. However, to date, no monoclonal antibodies or structures of PfHAP2 have been generated. We have identified nanobodies that bind specifically to domain 3 of PfHAP2 with nanomolar affinities, two of which show some cross-species reactivity with HAP2 of other Plasmodium species. The crystal structure of one nanobody in complex with domain 3 of PfHAP2 provides the first structural insights into this transmission-blocking target in P. falciparum."

In this study, the effects of soil quality and microbial diversity in the field bulk soil and rhizosphere on the development of postharvest diseases were investigated. Microbial genera in bulk soil and rhizosphere samples were identified by Illumina Miseq amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S and fungal ITS regions. Disease symptoms in the stored carrots were monitored after six months of cold storage, and the main pathogens were identified. The field sites with mineral soils, which had a higher pH, had a higher bacterial and fungal diversity than organic soils. The organically managed fields had a higher bacterial diversity than the conventionally managed fields. Community structure of both bacteria and fungi was largely driven by field site including its main chemical characteristics, with rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from the same site displaying comparable assemblages. Higher soil microbial diversity was associated with higher postharvest storability in the stored carrots. The weather during the growing season also had an effect on the observed fungal biodiversity, which was higher at sites that had lower temperatures and less rain prior to harvest."

    "content": "Bacteriophages (phages) are well known to be one of the major driving forces in bacterial evolution. This also applies to virulent microorganisms, such as the major human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, whose pathogenic potential and epidemic proliferation largely depends on the interaction with environmental phages. Specifically, integration of the CTXphi; phage genome into the first chromosome of V. cholerae also introduced the ctxAB genes, encoding the primary toxin responsible for the severe acute diarrheal disease, cholera. Whereas the mechanisms underlying CTXphi-associated horizontal gene transfer and transcriptional control of the ctxAB genes have been intensively studied over the past years, post-transcriptional regulation affecting the CTXphi life-cycle has not been documented. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the CisR small RNA (sRNA) that is produced from the 3UTR (untranslated region) of the prtV gene and inhibits the expression of the CTXphi-encoded cep mRNA. CisR-mediated repression of cep involves Hfq-assisted base-pairing of the two transcripts and results in reduced CTXphi production under stress conditions. We further demonstrate that transcription of prtV-cisR requires both the master quorum-sensing regulator HapR and CRP, a global regulator of carbon metabolism. Taken together, our work provides evidence that V. cholerae employs sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation to coordinate CTXphi activation with both cell density and nutrient availability."

Here, we determine in-situ near-atomic structures of the sheathed flagellar motor inside intact cells. The motor anchors to the outer membrane through lipidated HL-rings without forming a membrane pore, thereby allowing axial assembly to drive sheath formation. Conserved LP-rings act as slide-rotary bushings that permit high-speed rotation within a dynamic envelope yet can constrict to seal the pore upon stress-induced ejection. We further show that stator activation requires a specific PomB-MotX interaction rather than peptidoglycan engagement. Together, these findings reveal how the distinctive architecture and dynamics of the sheathed flagellum promote V. cholerae motility, environmental survival, and persistent colonization of the human gut."

    "content": "Members of the bacterial phylum Bacteroidota inhabit a wide range of ecosystems. Although significant progress has been made over the past decade in understanding the metabolic functions of clinically relevant Bacteroidota, far less is known about the environmental species. Despite being one of the dominant phyla linked to crops, there is limited information on the mechanisms that enable Bacteroidota to thrive in plant and soil environments. A key obstacle in understanding gene fitness in Bacteroidota is the lack of genome-wide functional studies, largely due to their inherent resistance to antibiotics, which complicates genetic manipulation. In this study, we used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to measure gene fitness in a plant-associated Bacteroidota, Mucilaginibacter yixingensis YX-36. Our data sheds light on pathways involved in rhizosphere colonization, gliding motility, stress tolerance, and carbon metabolism. Notably, we found that phylum-specific genes such as Polysaccharide Utilization Loci (PULs) and Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) are needed for fitness in the plant niche. Overall, this work advances our understanding of gene functions in environmental Bacteroidota species and provides a foundation for future research on their roles in plant-microbe interactions."

Here, we explored the microbial and glycobiological connectivity between the sea surface microlayer (SML), the underlying seawater (ULW), snow, and aerosol particles in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, 79N) during autumn and spring. The marked overlap between marine and atmospheric microbiomes illustrates considerable sea-air transfer, linked to seasonally distinct environmental communities. For instance, Polaribacter and Formosa were aerosolized during the spring bloom, compared to Colwellia in autumn. Air-mass trajectories and microbial source tracking revealed a greater marine contribution in autumn, whereas spring aerosols were shaped by stronger winds and the cryosphere. Aerosol particles nonetheless contained numerous unique taxa, including Actinobacteria likely originating from terrestrial sources. Linking bacterial, microeukaryotic, carbohydrate, and meteorological dynamics established an overarching perspective across seasons and habitats, identifying four distinct ecosystem states. Genome-sequenced bacterial model isolates, representing key environmental populations, encode adaptive traits such as carotenoid and ectoine biosynthesis, supporting survival in the SML and atmospheric transfer. Comparison with time-series records from the nearby Fram Strait revealed that many aerosolized bacteria are consistent microbiome components; with implications for ecology and biogeochemistry across the wider Arctic."

Transient NO2- accumulation is common but varies among bacteria. Despite its potential toxicity and its role in NO and N2O emissions, the regulatory mechanisms governing NO2- accumulation remain poorly understood. We profiled eighteen closely related Stutzerimonas strains, including the model S. perfectomarina ZoBell, and identified three phenotypic clusters (full, partial and low nitrite accumulators; FNA, PNA and LNA) based on the fraction of NO3--N transiently accumulated as NO2-. FNA and PNA strains carry both periplasmic (NapA) and membrane-bound (NarG) NO3- reductases. FNA strains carry the nitrite reductase NirS clade 1b and NirTB, potentially regulating nirS, while PNA strains carry NirS clade 1a and lack NirTB. FNA showed delayed transcription of nirS when NO3- was present, likely explaining its NO2- accumulation phenotype. LNA strains lack narG or express it late, balancing NO2- production. Addition of NO3- halted NO2- reduction in FNA but not in others, indicating metabolic control beyond transcription. Our findings reveal diverse NO2--handling phenotypes among denitrifiers and provide insights for optimizing wastewater nitrogen removal and soil bioaugmentation strategies to mitigate N2O emissions."

While mass spectrometry-coupled ribosome profiling of the mesophilic methanoarchaeon Methanosarcina mazei has recently unveiled a wealth of novel small ORFs, the functional roles of most of their products remain unknown. Here, we report the characterization of MttQ (98 aa) and MttS (49 aa), products of small ORFs situated in an operon alongside genes encoding a drug-metabolite-efflux (DME) family transporter (mttP) and other enzymes involved in trimethylamine (TMA) degradation. MttS and MttQ interact with MttP to form a stable oligomeric complex spanning the cytoplasmic membrane. TMA transport activity of the MttQ/MttS/MttP-complex is demonstrated via in vivo Escherichia coli cells heterologously expressing this system. Based on the reduced growth of a M. mazei mutant lacking mttS, on TMA as sole carbon source, we conclude that MttS governs the specificity of TMA transport. We posit that interactions between a DME transporter, e.g., MttP, and small proteins fueled evolution of the MttPQS complex and the advent of selective TMA uptake in methylotrophic methanoarchaea. These findings suggest an evolutionary mechanism on how small accessory proteins can alter conserved core functions in order to explore new ecological niches. Further, given that TMA levels in the human bloodstream influence cardiovascular disease risk but can be degraded by host-associated methanoarchaea containing a homolog of the MttPQS-complex, our findings present insight into an archaeal pathway with relevance to human health."

To investigate how these abiotic stressors interact with viral infection, we analyzed the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans acclimated to simulated microgravity (G) and below-background muon radiation flux (BBR), upon infection with Orsay virus (OrV). Using RNA-seq, we characterized gene expression profiles across single and combined stress conditions. Both G and BBR elicited distinct stress responses, including modulation of oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and immune pathways. OrV infection alone induced robust transcriptional changes, but its impact was significantly attenuated when combined with either abiotic stress, suggesting antagonistic interactions. Notably, proviral genes such as drl-1, fat-7 and hipr-1 were downregulated under BBR and G, potentially impairing viral replication. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment in immune effectors, RNA metabolism, and proteostasis-related pathways, particularly under BBR. Viral load and RNA2/RNA1 ratios were reduced in both stress conditions, indicating a shift in viral replication dynamics. Moreover, genomic diversity and defective viral genome formation were differentially affected, with increased genetic diversity and structural variation under stress. These findings suggest that acclimation to off-Earth conditions primes the host for a dampened response to an acute viral infection, potentially through resource reallocation and transcriptional attenuation. This study provides transcriptomic insight into viral infection under space-relevant conditions, highlighting complex stress interactions and their implications for host-pathogen dynamics in extraterrestrial environ-ments."

Their robustness and adaptability make them relevant not only to terrestrial ecosystems but also to astrobiological exploration. As durable entities, they may persist in environments far harsher than those tolerable to cellular life and are likely candidates for forward contamination. To assess their relevance in planetary protection and as potential biomarkers, we investigated the preservation of bacteriophage Qb, an RNA virus, in Mars analog environments using two commercial Martian regolith simulants: MGS-1 and MMS-2. MMS-2, enriched in iron oxides, exhibited higher oxidative potential than MGS-1, which is mainly composed of basaltic material. Viral survival was assessed across variables including time, temperature, concentration, and particle size. Our results show that inactivation in MGS-1 was primarily driven by adsorption, while in MMS-2 it was dominated by chemical oxidation. MGS-1 provided a more protective matrix, mitigating freeze-induced damage and shielding desiccated viral particles from UV-B and UV-C radiation. These findings highlight the importance of mineral composition in modulating viral persistence and suggest that regolith may act as both a barrier and a refuge. Understanding virus mineral interactions is essential for assessing biosignature preservation, planetary protection, and the potential roles of viruses in the evolution and survival of life beyond Earth."

Among these, the NEL family E3 ubiquitin ligases (SlrP, SspH1, and SspH2) are known to modulate immune signaling, but the breadth of their impact on the host ubiquitylome remains unexplored. In this study, we have performed a global proteomic analysis to identify host proteins ubiquitylated in response to expression of these three effectors in human cells. Using enrichment strategies combined with mass spectrometry under conditions where the proteasome is active or not, we identified 214 putative substrates of ubiquitylation. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeleton organization, chromatin remodeling, and vesicular trafficking. In vitro ubiquitylation assays validated five novel substrates and revealed differential substrate specificity and patterns of ubiquitin chain topology among the effectors. Notably, expression of SspH1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupted polysome profiles in a ligase activity dependent manner, indicating a direct impact of the bacterial effector on translation of eukaryotic cells. Comparison with previously published global interactomes and ubiquitylomes supports a model in which Salmonella NEL effectors subvert a broader range of host pathways through targeted ubiquitylation. Our findings uncover new roles for NEL ubiquitin ligases in host manipulation and provide a holistic analysis of their effects on the ubiquitylome of the host cell, constituting a valuable resource for the study of bacterial pathogenesis and infection biology."

It is caused by several lyssaviruses and leads to an encephalitis, which is 100% fatal after symptom onset. The most common cause of rabies is the rabies virus (RABV), which leads to around 59,000 human deaths globally every year. The infection leads to drastic changes in host behaviour, but the underlying mechanistic details remain unclear. Although interactions between the viral glycoprotein and host nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been proposed as drivers of rabies-associated neurological dysfunction, clinical proteomic studies in naturally infected canines have been partially explored. In this study, we conducted a global proteomics analysis of RABV-infected and non-infected canine brain samples in India to unravel the changes in protein expression. Using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, we identified various host proteins and pathways dysregulated in the infected state. Approximately 700 proteins exhibited differential expression, with around 250 proteins involved in various pathways being significantly upregulated and approximately 500 proteins being significantly downregulated in the infected condition. Network clustering of the dysregulated proteins revealed functional modules, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin cytoskeletal regulation, and the TCA cycle, indicating widespread alterations in cellular trafficking, energy metabolism, and structural integrity. Complementary pathway enrichment through PANTHER identified processes linked to axon guidance, integrin signalling, chemokine and cytokine-mediated inflammation, and cytoskeletal regulation, underscoring the profound impact of rabies virus infection on neuronal connectivity and host immune responses"

    "content": "Extraction of high-quality RNA from microbial samples, especially complex microbiomes like the gut, remains a significant challenge. The instability of RNA, coupled with the abundance of RNases and difficult-to-lyse microbial cells, often results in degraded or low-yield RNA, hampering downstream applications. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we developed a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and efficient microbial RNA extraction method, which is equally effective for pure cultures and complex microbiomes. The method utilises low pH (4.7) and high temperature to lyse the cells, followed by rapid cooling to induce misfolded renaturation of genomic DNA and proteins. During the phase separation step, RNA remains in the aqueous phase and is subsequently precipitated using chilled isopropanol. The RNA suspended in double-distilled water (pH 6.5) remained stable for six months at -20 degree C. Further, we compared amplicon microbiome profiles generated from metagenomic DNA and cDNA (synthesised from extracted meta-RNA) derived from the broiler gut, taken as a model system. Our findings reveal that the cDNA-based amplicon microbiome composition more accurately deciphers the metabolically active population in gut environments that aligns with culture-based enumeration of viable microbes. This proof-of-concept study underscores the importance of meta-RNA approaches for functional microbiome analysis and provides a reliable RNA isolation method that can be broadly adopted for studies aiming to resolve active microbial community structure."

Those functions are largely dependent on the presence of highly adapted biological communities, for which, their microbial communities remain understudied. Our goal is to describe the bacterial communities across the groundwater-dependent ecosystems on Lanzarote, spanning a gradient of anthropogenic pollution using 16SrRNA amplicon sequencing. We sampled coastal caves and pools, wells and water galleries, springs, saltworks and marine bays affected by submarine groundwater discharge. Ecological analyses highlight that richness and composition of bacterial communities strongly depend on the type of habitats. Pathogens and human-derived species were ubiquitous in our samples, but, strikingly, caves and wells were strongly enriched with them compared to other habitats. We propose that our results highlight the susceptibility of groundwater environments to pollution and indicate that aquifers act as reservoirs of biological contamination in addition to natural diversity, regardless of their salinity. Since this enrichment might compromise some of the functions and services that groundwater-dependent ecosystems provide in oceanic islands, we call for integrative conservation strategies that include hydrological and biological perspectives into the decision making."

    "content": "A key challenge in ecosystem-based fisheries management is sustainably harvesting co-occurring species and populations that differ in their vulnerability to fishing. This challenge is exemplified in western Alaska Chinook salmon, where recent population declines have led to closures of in-river subsistence fisheries, but identifying the cause of these declines is limited by an inability to identify the river of origin for marine-caught fish in offshore fisheries that target more abundant species and populations. This problem is particularly acute for estimating the impacts of bycatch on individual salmon populations which have demographic independence but no genetic differentiation from which stock assignments can be made. Here we use machine learning approaches to assess the efficacy of using the microchemical history preserved in fish otoliths to assign individuals to their river of origin in western Alaska. We tested the classification ability of three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) combined with two time series smoothing techniques (Moving Average and Generalized Additive Models) to classify Chinook salmon to their river of origin using otolith time series data. Model accuracy ranged from 71.9% to 92.5%, with optimal performance achieved by Random Forest applied to GAM-smoothed data. Watershed-specific performance ranged from 86.8% to 93.7%, with most misclassifications occurring between spatially proximate Kuskokwim and Nushagak rivers. Raw predicted probabilities from classification algorithms were calibrated to reflect true class probabilities, enabling the incorporation of model results into decision analyses with explicit consideration of misclassification risk tolerance. The success of these models offers immediate utility for estimating marine mortality impacts across the region's three major river systems as well as an opportunity to understand commercial fisheries impacts on individual populations at substantially finer spatial scales than had been previously possible."

    "content": "As climate change accelerates, coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly exposed to co-occurring stressors whose combined effects are nonlinear and difficult to predict. Deoxygenation is a rapidly intensifying yet underrecognized threat to coral reefs that interacts with heat and acidification to alter coral physiology and stress resilience. However, the effects of hypoxia-related compound events on corals are largely unknown, underscoring the need for multi-stressor studies. Here, we conducted two extended-exposure experiments (12-17 days) across the coral species Porites furcata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, to disentangle the individual and combined effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) with either heat or acidification. We measured eight phenotypic traits related to growth, metabolism, and symbiosis health to test whether hypoxia imposes energetic constraints or other physiological stress that amplify the effects of heat or acidification. Standardized effect size analysis across 24 stressor-trait combinations revealed 13 additive, 10 synergistic, and only one antagonistic response. Hypoxia consistently suppressed dark respiration by 37-49% across species and altered photophysiology in the two Porites species, whereas acidification alone had minimal effects, particularly in S. siderea. Heat stress caused the most pronounced declines across nearly all traits, and when combined with hypoxia, it produced the highest number of synergistic interactions. In contrast, the combination of hypoxia and acidification largely resulted in additive responses, suggesting that independent physiological mechanisms underlie these effects. All corals showed strong metabolic depression under hypoxia which is likely beneficial as a short-term adaptive response but may impose energetic constraints in the long-term. These findings highlight deoxygenation as critical yet often overlooked drivers of coral reef vulnerability. More multi-stressor experiments across a range of species are urgently needed to improve predictions of reef resilience under future ocean conditions, where compound stress events are expected to become more frequent and severe."

    "content": "Incorporating metacommunity perspectives into bioassessment represents a major challenge in the management of drying river networks, where drying-induced fragmentation compromises the performance of biological indices to assess their ecological status. Indeed, current indices focus on local community responses to stressors and neglect the effect of regional processes, such as spatiotemporal connectivity and dispersal, on metacommunity assembly. In this work, we explored the effect of drying on the performance of a widely used biological index using metacommunity simulations on a synthetic drying river network. We assessed how different gradients of drying-driven fragmentation and human impact extent determine local richness and the biological index scores by combining simulations with biomonitoring information. We used a coalescent metacommunity model to simulate the exchange of individuals between local communities along synthetic drying river networks. These networks were subjected to different drying extent, drying intensity and human impact extent scenarios. Additionally, we considered two major characteristics for each simulated taxon: (i) tolerance to human impacts and (ii) dispersal strategy (flying, swimming, or drifting). For each simulation, we obtained local richness and the biological index value. Then, we calculated biological index performance, which we defined as the capacity to distinguish between impacted and non-impacted sites. Finally, we tested our approach in six non-impacted European drying river networks, from which drying information was available. Our results showed that low spatiotemporal connectivity consistently led to decreased local richness and low scores of the biological index (reflecting poor biological quality). As drying extent and intensity increased, drying-induced fragmentation significantly reduced the biological index performance. For example, with a 50% increase in drying extent, index performance fell over 70% and at high drying levels, this performance dropped more than 90%. This decay followed a convex pattern, with a marked drop in performance as soon as drying appeared in the catchment and leveling off at higher drying extents. Synthesis and applications: We show how simulations can be used to incorporate network fragmentation and metacommunity dynamics into the design and validation of biomonitoring tools, thereby increasing their efficiency."

    "content": "Estuaries are ecologically vital yet highly impacted ecosystems that serve as transitional zones between land and sea. Monitoring their biodiversity is essential but challenging due to their dynamic nature and the transient presence of many species. Traditionally actinopterygian monitoring in these systems still relies on conventional and intrusive methods such as gill nets and trawls. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a non-invasive, multi-taxa alternative that can complement these traditional approaches. Here, we applied an eDNA-based metabarcoding approach to characterize vertebrate diversity in the Rance Estuary, located in the Brittany Region of France. Water samples were collected from five stations spanning marine to freshwater environments. Special attention was given to two stations located upstream and downstream of the tidal power plant (TPP) dam to assess its potential impact on ecological continuity. We detected a total of 124 distinct vertebrate MOTUs, comprising actinopterygians, birds, mammals, and amphibians. Taxonomic composition followed the estuarine gradient, with Jaccard dissimilarity increasing with distance from the sea and largely driven by species turnover. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity remained relatively stable across the vertebrate community, functional diversity revealed an increasing terrestrial influence. For actinopterygians, taxonomic diversity decreased upstream, whereas phylogenetic and functional diversity indicated fine-scale structuring, even among nearby stations. This approach enabled the development of biodiversity metrics and facilitated comparisons with previous actinopterygian monitoring surveys in the same area based on conventional methods (scientific fishing using nets and dredges). Our results emphasise the potential of eDNA for holistic estuarine biomonitoring and establish a valuable baseline for future non-invasive assessments."
