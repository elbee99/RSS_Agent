The forest line has moved upward since the 1850s, driven by the regional abandonment of grazing and the presence of the mountain pine. Despite the recent acceleration of this shift, the closed forest line has moved upward even faster."

    "content": "Abstract\nReliable paleotemperature proxies are essential for reconstructing past climate. To refine interpretation of the MBT'5ME index, based on bacterial brGDGT lipids, a year\u2010long study was conducted in Rotsee, Switzerland, a seasonally stratified lake with a 4\u201321\u00b0C temperature range. Suspended particulate matter was collected monthly from the epilimnion and the hypolimnion, complemented by surface sediments and surrounding soils. Both intact polar (IPL) and core lipid (CL) brGDGTs were analyzed alongside 16S rRNA gene data to disentangle environmental (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH) and biological (microbial community) controls on brGDGT compositions. In the stratified epilimnion, MBT'5ME values showed a muted response to summer warming (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.1), whereas the isomer ratio (IR) correlated more strongly with temperature (r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). MBT'5ME and IR were also significantly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), providing a novel diagnostic tool to identify sedimentary GDGTs derived from surface waters. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with pH (r\u00a0=\u00a00.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IR with dissolved oxygen (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.65 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Microbial DNA analysis revealed low Acidobacterial abundances (<0.4% of reads), suggesting MBT'5ME patterns are not solely driven by this phylum. Instead, hypolimnion IPL\u2010brGDGTs correlated with gene abundance of several other bacteria, indicating broader microbial contributions. Surface sediments reflected an integrated water column signal, while also showing evidence for additional in situ IPL\u2010brGDGT production. Overall, findings demonstrate that stratification onset drives MBT'5ME variability, while epilimnion temperature exerts stronger control on IR, refining their application in paleoclimate proxies."

    "content": "Abstract\nWetlandscapes\u2014networks of hydrologically connected wetlands\u2014can influence the transport and transformation of nutrients across watersheds. As climate change and human activity reshape wetland extent and connectivity, these landscape\u2010scale processes are being altered in ways that may intensify eutrophication in downstream lakes. We used Landsat\u2010derived inundation data (1984\u20132020) to evaluate how long\u2010term changes in wetlandscape properties have affected nutrient loading and phytoplankton bloom dynamics in Lake Winnipeg, Canada. Over this period, wetlands generally increased in number and size and exhibited greater connectivity to rivers and the lake but with declines observed after \u223c2015. These changes coincided with periods of substantial increases in the magnitude and spatial extents of phytoplankton blooms followed by declines in 2015 in the North Basin. Sub\u2010watersheds with shorter runoff travel distances to the lake showed stronger relationships between wetland connectivity and bloom metrics (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.10), suggesting reduced opportunity for nutrient retention and transformation. Incorporating runoff travel distance into wetlandscape assessments improved correlations with nutrient inputs and bloom extent. Rising surface temperatures further contributed to bloom intensification. These findings highlight how climate\u2010driven changes in wetland connectivity influence lake nutrient dynamics and demonstrate the potential for globally available satellite data to support spatially targeted water quality management."

    "content": "Abstract\nRecent advancements in remote sensing imagery classification have greatly improved monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics, deepening our understanding of their effects on ecosystems and terrestrial nutrient cycling. Forecasting LULC change remains challenging because it is strongly influenced by socioeconomic drivers and biogeochemical processes linked to land management and climate change. To address this complexity, a wide range of models has been developed, from process\u2010based to statistical approaches. Yet, comparisons at regional and global scales reveal large discrepancies, underscoring the need for more consistent calibration and validation with historical observations. Here, we leverage the increasing availability of annual LULC maps to evaluate the temporal performance of two independent data\u2010driven approaches: ARIMA time\u2010series forecasting and a deterministic Lotka\u2013Volterra ecological\u2010inspired model, across the R\u00edo de la Plata Grasslands, a threatened South American ecosystem. Both methods outperformed memoryless Markov chain models in capturing annual LULC transitions without requiring time\u2010consuming processing spatial inputs. These results demonstrate that incorporating long\u2010term annual LULC histories can substantially improve predictive skill and provide a robust framework for model intercomparison, with clear implications for linking land\u2010cover change to ecosystem and Earth system modeling."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change is now a reality, one that requires and will continue to require robust scientific information to guide mitigation and adaptation policies. Although this is true for all countries worldwide, low\u2010 and middle\u2010gross domestic product countries (LMGDP) face major technical, institutional, and financial barriers to producing such knowledge. These constraints limit their ability to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, define clear mitigation pathways, and design robust adaptation strategies. In contrast, freely available global scientific data are increasingly abundant. Open\u2010access resources from a wide range of institutions provide high\u2010quality climate and socioeconomic information at no cost. Leveraging these resources, combined with targeted capacity building and equitable international partnerships, offers a pathway to reduce research costs, avoid duplication, and strengthen policy\u2010relevant science in these countries. Addressing the paradox of global data abundance versus local data scarcity requires not only open data but open collaboration that integrates global expertise with local knowledge. In this commentary, two critical topics are employed to illustrate this challenge: (a) the calculation of reliable national GHG budgets essential for effective mitigation and (b) the development of adaptation pathways within nationally determined contributions. Strengthening national capacities while harnessing global data sets represents a crucial step toward enabling LMGDP countries to respond effectively to climate change."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe interannual variations of wintertime mixed layer depth (MLD) in the northern South China Sea (SCS), a region characterized by the deepest MLD within the basin and subduction process, are elucidated based on the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA, version 2.2.4) reanalysis data between 1950 and 2010. Our results reveal that the wintertime MLD possesses two predominant modes of 2\u20134\u2010year and 7\u20138\u2010year, involving different dynamical processes. Responses of thermal structure to local air\u2010sea interface factors primarily explain the 2\u20134\u2010year period MLD variability, with sea surface net heat flux playing a more crucial role than wind stress curl. Whereas for the 7\u20138\u2010year period MLD variability, Luzon Strait Transport (LST), high\u2010dense inflow from the Pacific Ocean into the northern SCS, is the dominant driver, while local air\u2010sea interface factors play a minor role. The difference between surface and subsurface layers inflow (\u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$), which is appropriate to represent the LST impact on vertical density gradient, can effectively modulate the upper layer stratification intensity in the northern SCS. Thus, a stronger (weaker) \u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$ conduces to establish a more unstable (stable) state therein, favorable to a vigorous (stagnant) vertical mixing and MLD deepening. Further analyses demonstrate the importance of both horizontal heat and salt advections related to LST in the northern SCS. That is to say, different from the 2\u20134\u2010year MLD variability, the salinity effect is of importance in driving this 7\u20138\u2010year MLD variability."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Southern Ocean plays a critical role in climate change while it remains incompletely understood due to lack of observations. This work utilizes the unique collection of temperature measurements from eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs) deployed along repeated transects together with the available Argo profiles across the Southern Ocean south of South Africa to examine long\u2010term temperature changes in this region. Summertime temperature sections in the upper 800\u00a0m were constructed along the XBT transect using 2,833 XBT and 1,631 Argo profiles during the period 2004\u20132020. The results show different temperature changes north and south of the Polar Front (PF): (a) north of the PF: warming from 2004/2005 to 2011/2012 and cooling from 2011/2012 to 2019/2020 in the top 300\u00a0m, which are linked to the wind field changes associated with the Southern Annual Mode, and meridional shifts of the PF and the Subantarctic Front; (b) south of the PF: consistent warming in the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) below 200\u00a0m and cooling above in the surface layer during the whole study period. The warming trend in the CDW is small but significant compared with the interannual variability. These temperature changes south of the PF might be due to the reduced vertical mixing caused by the freshening of the surface water induced by the increased sea ice melting. These findings improve understanding of observed temperature changes in the south of South Africa and provide means to establish a connection across the Southern Ocean."

    "content": "Abstract\nTidal mixing in the Kara Gates Strait (KGS) modulates transport of warm water from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea, playing a pivotal role in the transformation of Atlantic Water and the heat budget of the Arctic. Although previous studies have identified the presence of large\u2010amplitude internal waves by the interaction of M2 tidal currents with rough topography, understanding of the energetics and dynamics of M2 internal tides (ITs) in the KGS remains limited. Using a high\u2010resolution model, this study investigates the generation, propagation, and dissipation of M2 ITs. The results reveal that, in addition to the previously identified source in the central KGS, the slope of Vaygach Island serves as another major source of ITs with energy intensity exceeding that of the central strait. Background circulation confines the ITs within \u223c10\u00a0km off the slope forming atypical coastal trapped waves (CTWs). Theoretical solutions for these CTWs reveal a dominance of high vertical modes with energy dissipation exhibiting a \u201csandwich\u2010like\u201d structure. Applying the Lagrangian filtering, internal tides and lee waves along the KGS are separated. Dissipation associated with lee waves ranges from 10\u22127 to 10\u22126\u00a0W/kg comparable to those induced by ITs, yet their role in driving local mixing has been largely underestimated in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the dynamics around the KGS and their implications for Arctic tidal mixing processes."

The autonomous totivirus and its satellite can coexist but with an asymmetric dependence of the satellite on the totivirus for replication and maintenance inside the host cell. Satellites provide their yeast hosts with inhibitory toxins and the necessary self-immunity; loss of the satellite equates to loss of toxin immunity. Because these viral elements lack known extracellular stages, and sex is suspected to be rare, they are assumed to be transmitted vertically, implying that infection states should correlate with host genotypes. However, totivirus\u2013satellite coinfections are rarely examined in natural populations, leaving their associations with host genotypes poorly understood. We screened a multiyear, vineyard-associated population of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S. cerevisiae</span> isolates from New Zealand to examine the stability of host\u2013virus associations over time, both within and across genotypes. Over half of the wild isolates harbored infections (55%), but less than half of these (37% of infected) had toxin-encoding satellites. Genotypes that persisted across years typically maintained consistent infection states. However, we also observed stepwise transitions from coinfection through infection to an infection-free state, as well as acquisition of totiviruses and satellites. Genotypes clustered strongly by infection state, and population heterozygosity was significantly lower than expected, supporting vertical transmission while suggesting that outcrossing is not responsible for the acquisition of higher infection states. Despite occasional intragenotypic transitions, genotype clustering by infection state remained intact, suggesting that such transitions are transient and that host genotypes may have optimal infection states with regard to totiviruses and their satellites.</span>"

Despite their ecological and cultural significance, crocodilians are a taxon that remains underexplored in microbiome research. We investigated cloacal bacteriome samples from both wild and captive populations to identify compositional and functional differences resulting from captivity. Our findings reveal significant alterations in bacterial diversity and community structure in captive crocodiles, with notable shifts at both phylum and family levels; specifically, Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota dominate in captivity, whereas wild crocodiles exhibit a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota and Bacillota. The Shannon diversity index indicates a significant reduction in bacterial diversity among captive individuals, likely due to husbandry practices that foster a microbially depauperate environment. Additionally, serum metabolomics analysis shows an enrichment of alcohol sugars in captive crocodiles, alongside a decrease in pantothenic acid. While this is the first study to characterize these traits in saltwater crocodiles, further research is necessary to determine the physiological consequences of these bacterial and metabolic changes on host fitness and adaptability. Longitudinal studies are essential for understanding how bacterial communities evolve over time and in response to environmental factors, which will inform conservation strategies and improve the management of captive populations of crocodilians intended for reintroduction into the wild.</span>"

For Arctic lakes, increasing meltwater and precipitation may enhance the inputs of nutrients, organic matter and microorganisms from their catchments, and the increasingly ice-free, open-water conditions of the Arctic Ocean may favor increased inputs of marine aerosols, including microbiota. This study therefore aimed to determine how changing connectivity to terrestrial and marine habitats may affect the dispersal, sorting, and establishment of bacterial communities in a coastal High Arctic lake. Three habitats in this model system were sampled for ice, water, and snow: the lake, inflowing water tracks over permafrost soils, and an adjacent ice-dammed bay connected to the Arctic Ocean. Lake water chemistry confirmed the hydrological connection between the lake and terrestrial habitats, with the lake fed by terrestrial carbon sources via snow and groundwater run-off. Sequencing of 16S rDNA and rRNA showed evidence of a small marine and terrestrial influence on the lake, but few bacterial phylotypes were common to all three connected habitats. These results imply ongoing strong environmental filtering by habitat type, despite the apparent and potentially rising connectivity, and provide an example of bacterial resilience in a region of rapid climate change.</span>"

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nWe studied the drivers of population\u2010genetic structuring and genetic diversity in specialist parasites based on whole\u2010genome resequencing data from 82 Echinophthirius horridus seal louse individuals sampled from 12 ecologically and behaviourally different phocine seal species, subspecies and populations across the Holarctic. We found that the main genetic disjunctions in E. horridus lice occur across seal host species and subspecies, with a further level of population subdivision emerging among host individuals within some populations. Endemic and relict landlocked seal (sub)species host the genetically most distinct louse populations, while lice associated with sympatric marine seals show signatures of occasional gene flow across hosts. Within the latter, the most extreme case is seen in the near\u2010panmictic lice associated with northern European grey and harbour seals, which aggregate in shared rookeries and colonies. Although the louse and seal phylogenies were overall statistically significantly congruent, evidence for similar host shifts in the past is reflected in several conflicts in the phylogenetic trees of the lice and their hosts. Population\u2010level mean heterozygosity and theta in seal lice varied considerably, and both measures of genetic variation were statistically significantly related to host population size. Taken together, our results support a non\u2010adaptive model of parasite diversification, in which geographic and behavioural isolation among hosts drives parasite genetic differentiation, and genetic erosion in bottlenecked hosts cascades up to their specialist parasites. Our results provide new insights into processes that generate parasite diversity and trigger parallel losses of genetic diversity in endangered host\u2013parasite systems."

We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical <i>slow-fast dissection</i> method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations."

In contexts of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This paper presents extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary processes (such as birth) of the model directly from the data. We additionally incorporate a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process hyperparameters to the data.\nSeveral test cases are considered, demonstrating the method\u2019s performance for several standard models from population modeling, including age and size-structured models.

Here, we identify that BRCA1 protein stability is controlled through ubiquitin lysine 11 (K11)-linkage modification under the regulation of Cezanne deubiquitinating enzyme, APC/C E3 ligase, and Ube2S E2 conjugating enzyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cezanne-deficiency leads to increased BRCA1 K11-ubiquitination, decreased BRCA1 protein level, and increased cellular sensitivity to PARPi. The BRCA1 K11-linked ubiquitination is carried out through a degron on BRCA1 that is recognized by APC/C cofactor Cdh1. Tumor expression and mutational analyses indicate that Cezanne low or Ube2S high expression is associated with \u201cBRCAness\u201d and correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our study has demonstrated a ubiquitin K11-linked ubiquitination pathway that regulates BRCA1 protein stability, dysregulation of which predicts BRCA1-deficiency that may be effectively targeted with PARPi therapy."

Here, we studied how food supply and TOR signaling regulate the cell cycle in a multipotent population of Vasa2-/Piwi1-expressing cells in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signaling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signaling activation and S-phase re-entry, and led to a global decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells. This strongly suggests that <i>Nematostella</i> Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, a phenomenon previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture. The nutritional control of quiescence and cell proliferation may thus be a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved strategy underlying the environmental regulation of indeterminate growth in animals."

Here, we used Sf9 cells to express HCAR3-Gi and HCAR2-Gi complexes, and present cryo-EM structures of HCAR3-Gi complexes with agonists compound 6O (3.31 \u00c5), D-phenyllactic acid (3.05 \u00c5), IBC293 (3.26 \u00c5), and acifran (3.18\u00c5), as well as HCAR2-Gi complex with agonist acifran (2.72 \u00c5). Our findings reveal the mechanism behind 6O\u2019s highest affinity to HCAR3, attributed to its full occupation of both R1 and R2 regions of the orthosteric binding pocket. Moreover, combined with cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells, we have elucidated that the ligand selectivity between HCAR3 and HCAR2 depended on <i>\u03c0</i>\u2013<i>\u03c0</i> interaction with F107<sup>3.32</sup> (L107<sup>3.32</sup> in HCAR2) and ligand-binding pocket size difference, facilitated by key residues difference V/L83<sup>2.60</sup>, Y/N86<sup>2.63</sup>, and S/W91<sup>23.48</sup>. Collectively, these structural insights lay the groundwork for developing HCAR3-specific drugs, potentially avoiding HCAR2-induced adverse effects."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104242",
    "content": "Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC), repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles, indicating high trial-by-trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation in awake mice to study how increased activity of single cells affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched their tuning property, while non-co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results show that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent."

    "content": "Abstract\nDeep long\u2010period (DLP) earthquakes have been observed at many volcanic settings around the world and linked to the magmatic processes that drive volcanic unrest. At the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) of the Cascade arc, limited detection of DLP activity hinders classification of anomalous seismic behavior and its relationship to the LVC magmatic system. This study uses a template matching approach with seismic data from temporary nodal and permanent stations to detect and locate DLP earthquakes near the LVC between 2017 and 2024. Within the DLP catalog of 611 events, a transition occurs from scattered (2017\u20132020) to oscillatory (2021\u20132024) occurrence rates. During the oscillatory period, regional earthquakes with large amplitude velocity waveforms observed near the LVC are associated with abrupt changes in DLP occurrence rates. Continued monitoring of DLP activity has the potential to better define the processes that drive volcanic unrest at the LVC in the future."

    "content": "Abstract\nUncorrected long\u2010wavelength contributions remain a major limitation for interpreting InSAR time\u2010series over large areas (>100\u00a0km). Among them, the ionosphere can impact InSAR measurements across various timescales, potentially biasing secular velocity estimates. We use Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) to predict ionospheric effects for >15,000 Sentinel\u20101 acquisitions in France, Tibet, and Central Andes. We evaluate GIM\u2010based corrections using phase ramps (planar functions fitted to interferograms) as proxies for long\u2010wavelength signals, enabling analysis of their temporal evolution. After correcting for solid Earth tides and oceanic tidal loading, GIM\u2010derived predictions show a strong temporal consistency with observed ramps, effectively capturing seasonal and multi\u2010year fluctuations with amplitudes of \u223c ${\\sim} $0.2\u00a0mm/km. The highest\u2010resolution GIM also corrects part of the strong daily fluctuations of along\u2010track ramps observed on ascending tracks over equatorial regions. These corrections reduce ramp rate uncertainty and improve agreement with GNSS, paving the way toward direct InSAR measurement of tectonic plate motion."

Using the combined COSMIC\u2010Arase data set, we provide a convenient way to reconcile the two regions in empirical models based on the analytical Chapman function inversion for scale height.

However, the geomagnetic reversal pattern during the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition remains elusive. Here we present an integrated magneto\u2010 and cyclo\u2010stratigraphic study of a \u223c1.8\u2010Myr\u2010long, late Ediacaran succession in Newfoundland, Canada. We obtained a reversal frequency of 10\u201312\u00a0Myr\u22121, documenting a hyperactively reversing geodynamo during the late Ediacaran. Together with the updated reversal records and paleointensity data sets, we propose a >70\u2010Myr\u2010long interval of geomagnetic reversal hyperactivity before the Ordovician Reversed Superchron, forming a hyperactivity\u2010superchron couplet that recurs in the mid\u2010Paleozoic and Mesozoic.

    "content": "Abstract\nReservoirs provide key water storage in regions facing projected water scarcity and population growth. Many reservoirs experience water level fluctuations including periods of drawdown tied to drought. To examine sensitivity of water clarity to drawdown, we compiled 30\u00a0years of water level and Secchi depth measurements in southern Great Plains reservoirs (n\u00a0=\u00a084) positioned across a climate gradient from the arid west to the wetter east. Mixed\u2010effect models incorporated reservoir\u2010specific coefficients relating Secchi depth to water storage volume. Predictions from the best model indicated that many reservoirs lost more than half of their Secchi depth as water levels approached their recorded lows. Reservoirs in west and central Texas tended to experience more severe drawdown and more pronounced loss of water clarity during drawdown. These results show that droughts can cause a dual setback in which the loss of water quantity coincides with loss of water quality in reservoirs."

We present petrological and geochemical analyses of six very\u2010low\u2010Ti (VLT) basalt fragments from Chang'e\u20106 (CE6) samples. These basalts yield a Pb\u2010Pb age of around 2.9\u00a0Ga, representing the youngest reported VLT volcanism. They are slightly older than the low\u2010Ti basalts from the same soils and exhibit distinct pyroxene compositions and 238U/204Pb ratios, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Compared to Apollo and Luna VLT basalts, these samples share similarly depleted Sr\u2010Pb isotopes but display elevated rare earth element concentrations and TiO2 contents. These basalts most likely derived from low\u2010degree melting of an olivine\u2010orthopyroxene source followed by 30%\u201340% fractional crystallization. Further diffusion chronometry reveals rapid magma ascent from magma chamber to surface, likely facilitated by the thin lunar crust resulting from the South Pole\u2010Aitken basin\u2010forming impact.

Based on radar interferometry over a large field\u2010of\u2010view, the BSL was revealed to occur over a limited area northeastward of the radar and did not cause scintillation when Global Navigation Satellite System satellites passed through. The BSL vertical displacement precisely followed the F\u2010layer bottom fluctuation, without obvious horizontal movement. Interestingly, the localized BSL caused weak spread\u2010F traces in the ionograms indicating irregularities from specific directions, which are distinct from the satellite traces or range spread F related to plasma bubble development thus could serve as a new signature of BSL in future studies."

    "content": "Mammalian liver metabolism undergoes a substantial shift during fasting. Thermodynamic principles impose fundamental constraints on metabolism, and the Gibbs free energy change of reaction ({Delta}_r G) indicates the reaction direction and distance from equilibrium. However, {Delta}_r G landscapes in intact mammalian organs remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we mapped {Delta}_r G^' profile of glucose metabolism in mouse liver during fasting, using experimentally measured absolute metabolite concentrations and a newly developed computational method, GLEAM. We found that despite large metabolite fluctuations during fasting, the corresponding {Delta}_r Gs remained robust, even for reactions reversing the direction between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. A remarkable thermodynamic robustness is found in maintaining potential candidates of rate-limiting steps during fasting. This robustness is achieved by expending substantial costs for enzyme expressions, contributing to efficient switching from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, obese mouse liver also showed thermodynamic robustness despite obesity-induced metabolic disruption. Our framework provided a novel thermodynamic perspective on intact organ metabolism, demonstrating that the liver robustly maintains thermodynamic characteristics favorable for metabolic control by buffering metabolite concentration differences."

    "content": "Organisation and dynamics of chromatin play a key role in regulation of cell state and function. In cancer, chromatin plasticity is known to be important in control of drug resistance, but the relationship between chromatin compaction and chemotherapy response within complex tissue settings remains unclear. Here, we measured single nuclei chromatin compaction using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in situ in whole biopsies from 53 pre treatment and 14 post surgery tissue samples of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients to determine whether single nuclei spatial chromatin compaction state can predict resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Bulk chromatin compaction across 53 pre-treatment core biopsies did not predict patient outcome. However, machine learning analysis revealed that a subset of patients exhibited distinct distributions of single nuclei with more open chromatin states, which was predictive of NACT-resistance. Graph neural network analysis established that the spatial arrangement of chromatin compaction contributed to prediction of NACT resistance and that chromatin compaction signatures were preserved in tissue state transitions from pre- to 14 post-NACT samples. Our findings shed new light on spatial control of chromatin structure and relationship to therapeutic resistance and establish a foundation for further molecular analysis of chromatin states in complex biological tissues."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.03.692185v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Background: Alterations in amine metabolism have been implicated Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are key biofluids in AD research. CSF is considered to better reflect brain metabolic alterations than plasma, while plasma can be obtained more easily. However, plasma-CSF relationships are unclear. Aim: To investigate longitudinal changes of amines in plasma and CSF, and their correlation across the two, in male and female TgF344 AD transgenic versus wildtype (WT) rats. Method: LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics was used to analyze 60 and 55 amines in plasma and CSF, respectively, of male and female TgF344-AD and WT rats, at 12, 25, 50 and 85 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized logistic regressions, Pearson correlations, and differential correlations between groups and matrixes. Results: Compared to WT controls, at 12 weeks, TgF344-AD rats showed an increase of 3-methylhistidine, anserine, cysteine, s-methylcysteine, while at 25 weeks, male TgF344-AD rats showed pronounced increases in CSF levels of alpha-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, glycylglycine, glycylproline, histidine, isoleucine, kynurenine, leucine, methionine, methionine sulfone, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, and valine. At 50 weeks, female TgF344-AD rats exhibited reductions in CSF for DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, and putrescine. Distinct plasma-CSF correlations were found for 1-methylhistidine, 2-aminoadipic acid, putrescine, kynurenine, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-lysine, DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, and taurine, particularly in TgF344-AD rats. Conclusions: Body fluid, age- and sex-dependent amine alterations in CSF and plasma of TgF344-AD rats compared to WT controls provide important insights into AD disease processes and may aid early diagnosis and therapeutic targeting."

    "content": "The CRISPR-dCas9 system has emerged as a versatile platform for programmable gene regulation, offering unique advantages in modularity and orthogonality for constructing synthetic genetic circuits. Here, we present a novel architecture for biomolecular neural networks based on dCas9, guide RNAs, and antisense RNA sequestration. Through mathematical modeling and steady-state analysis, we demonstrate that this system functions as a molecular perceptron with a threshold activation function analogous to a saturated rectified linear unit (ReLU). However, a critical challenge in scaling these circuits is competition for the finite dCas9 pool, whose expression must remain low to avoid cytotoxicity. We address this constraint by developing a resource-aware design framework and characterizing how shared dCas9 availability affects network performance. Our results show that for classification tasks, decision boundaries remain invariant under resource competition, while for regression tasks, node thresholds are preserved despite sensitivity in output magnitude under heterogeneous binding conditions. We demonstrate the computational capabilities of this platform through both linear and nonlinear classification problems, as well the approximation of a band-pass function as a proof-of-concept regression task. This work expands the repertoire of molecular mechanisms capable of computation and establishes design principles for implementing CRISPR-based neuromorphic circuits that can execute complex computational tasks within the biochemical constraints of living cells."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.07.692803v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as key signaling intermediates in plant metabolism, defense, and stress adaptation. In photosynthetic organisms, chloroplast and mitochondria serve as the major hubs of ROS production, thereby coordinating stress responses across cellular compartments. However, the extent of cross-organellar communication following compartmentalized oxidative stress remains poorly understood. Using C. reinhardtii as a model system, we induced compartmentalized oxidative stress in chloroplast and mitochondria to investigate whether the ROS generation in one organelle triggers any functional response in the other organelle. Methyl viologen (MV) was used to induce ROS production in the chloroplast, while menadione (MD) was used to trigger mitochondrial ROS production. Real-time monitoring of compartment-specific roGFP strains showed specific, localized, and reversible ROS production following MV and MD treatment as a function of time within the respective target organelles. Comprehensive functional analyses following compartmentalized ROS perturbations revealed that the mitochondrial ROS remained localized to their site of origin and did not detectably affect chloroplast function, as evidenced by the unchanged chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and photosystem stoichiometry. In contrast, chloroplast-derived ROS diffused from its site of origin and transiently suppressed the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Together, these findings underscore a dynamically regulated system, where chloroplast ROS leaks out and affects mitochondrial function while the mitochondrial ROS remains localized and does not impact chloroplast function. These compartment-specific ROS responses likely represent an adaptive mechanism for coordinating cellular energy metabolism in response to fluctuating environmental conditions."

    "content": "Members of the class Ktedonobacteria (phylum Chloroflexota) are widespread across a variety of terrestrial environments. They are particularly enriched in silica-rich oligotrophic caves, where they may act as early colonizers, but the genomic bases supporting this pioneering capacity are still unclear. Here, we present a systematic genomic analysis of Ktedonobacteria from diverse ecosystems, with a focus on oligotrophic caves. Cave Ktedonobacteria belong to novel genera of Ktedonobacteraceae and harbor genes supporting a mixotrophic metabolism that combines the use of organic and inorganic substrates as energy and carbon sources. Comparative analyses of all available Ktedonobacteria genomes from diverse environments showed that most metabolic traits, including those enabling atmospheric gas oxidation, are primarily driven by taxonomy. In contrast, genes involved in CO2; fixation are enriched in Ktedonobacteria inhabiting caves. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the RuBisCO of Ktedonobacteria likely represents a novel Form I subtype, which we designate as BAK, reflecting its wide occurrence in thermophilic and acidophilic Bacillota and Actinomycetota inhabiting similar extreme environments. The presence of this subtype across distinct lineages in comparable habitats suggests that it may confer a selective advantage in nutrient-poor settings (like caves) and that its distribution may be subject to horizontal gene transfer. This autotrophic capacity relies on a transaldolase variant of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle that was previously described only in one Firmicutes species. Overall, this study provides genetic evidence supporting the combination of atmospheric gas oxidation with dark CO2; fixation in Ktedonobacteria, highlighting their role as primary producers in oligotrophic ecosystems, including caves."
