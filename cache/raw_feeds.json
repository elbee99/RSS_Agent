    "content": "We have rationally designed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) between the perovskite and hole transport layer to simultaneously mitigate defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in inorganic CsPbI3\u2010xBrx perovskite solar cells. As a result, the optimized device achieves an improved power conversion efficiency, increasing from 19.96% to 22.19%. Furthermore, the hydrophobic molecular structure of the chiral modifier significantly enhances the environmental stability of the solar cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nChiral materials exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to their non\u2010centrosymmetric structure. However, the influence of chiral configurations on halide vacancy repair and phase stability remains poorly understood, hindering the development of effective chiral passivation strategies for all\u2010inorganic perovskite solar cells. In this work, we rationally constructed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces between the perovskite and hole transport layer using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) to simultaneously suppress defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in CsPbI3\u2010xBrx solar cells. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that RAC\u2010NFA operates via a \u201cstereoselective complementarity\u201d mechanism, which not only inhibits halide vacancy formation through \u201clock\u2010and\u2010key\u201d coordination but also drives thermodynamically favorable secondary crystal growth and surface reconstruction, leading to larger, high\u2010quality grains. Additionally, the densely packed aromatic Fmoc groups at grain boundaries effectively suppress phase transition and moisture/oxygen penetration. RAC\u2010NFA modification further optimizes band alignment to enhance hole extraction and transport. Through these synergistic effects, the CsPbI3\u2010xBrx device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 22.19%, among the highest reported for such materials, while retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 800 h in ambient air. This work presents a synergistic passivation strategy that concurrently improves efficiency and stability, offering a promising route toward the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "content": "This review highlights how high configurational entropy and cocktail effects in HE\u2010PBAs helps in mitigating the intrinsic challenges of conventional PBAs as battery electrodes and electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions, with deep insights into the structure and electrochemical property relationship. Further, a perspective on the practical outcomes and potential for additional improvements is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh performance robust electrodes are demanding for next\u2010generation energy storage devices, especially to raise the energy density and cycle life of rechargeable batteries. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), a class of framework materials possessing a 3D structure have gained vast interest as battery electrodes due to a rich and multiple redox active sites offering tunable chemistry to reversibly store charges. Albeit the Jahn\u2013Teller distortions, structural phase transitions, low electronic conductivity, and lattice degradation certainly restrict the practicality of PBAs, requiring a rational engineering to exploit their properties. This review exclusively focuses on engineering the physical\u2010chemical\u2010electrochemical properties of PBA via high configurational entropy and the role of HE\u2010PBA toward activating the redox centers and improving the structure, cycle stability, and conductivity are elaborated. The entropically tuned HE\u2010PBAs endow synergistic \u201ccocktail effect\u201d benefitting structural robustness, alleviated/controlled phase transitions, multi\u2010electron redox activity, and performance improvements in batteries including lithium\u2010ion (Li\u2010ion), sodium\u2010ion (Na\u2010ion), lithium\u2010sulfur (Li\u2010S) and zinc\u2010ion (Zn\u2010ion) chemistries and catalytic conversion reactions. Further, the structure\u2010property relationship of HE\u2010PBAs in energy storage and catalytic systems are systematically discussed underpinning the role of redox elements in capacity retention, structural stability, phases transition, and cycle\u2010life. Alongside, a prospect on the practical outcomes and scope for further improvements are detailed.",
