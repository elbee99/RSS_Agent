    "content": "We have rationally designed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) between the perovskite and hole transport layer to simultaneously mitigate defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in inorganic CsPbI3\u2010xBrx perovskite solar cells. As a result, the optimized device achieves an improved power conversion efficiency, increasing from 19.96% to 22.19%. Furthermore, the hydrophobic molecular structure of the chiral modifier significantly enhances the environmental stability of the solar cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nChiral materials exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to their non\u2010centrosymmetric structure. However, the influence of chiral configurations on halide vacancy repair and phase stability remains poorly understood, hindering the development of effective chiral passivation strategies for all\u2010inorganic perovskite solar cells. In this work, we rationally constructed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces between the perovskite and hole transport layer using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) to simultaneously suppress defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in CsPbI3\u2010xBrx solar cells. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that RAC\u2010NFA operates via a \u201cstereoselective complementarity\u201d mechanism, which not only inhibits halide vacancy formation through \u201clock\u2010and\u2010key\u201d coordination but also drives thermodynamically favorable secondary crystal growth and surface reconstruction, leading to larger, high\u2010quality grains. Additionally, the densely packed aromatic Fmoc groups at grain boundaries effectively suppress phase transition and moisture/oxygen penetration. RAC\u2010NFA modification further optimizes band alignment to enhance hole extraction and transport. Through these synergistic effects, the CsPbI3\u2010xBrx device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 22.19%, among the highest reported for such materials, while retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 800 h in ambient air. This work presents a synergistic passivation strategy that concurrently improves efficiency and stability, offering a promising route toward the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "content": "This review highlights how high configurational entropy and cocktail effects in HE\u2010PBAs helps in mitigating the intrinsic challenges of conventional PBAs as battery electrodes and electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions, with deep insights into the structure and electrochemical property relationship. Further, a perspective on the practical outcomes and potential for additional improvements is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh performance robust electrodes are demanding for next\u2010generation energy storage devices, especially to raise the energy density and cycle life of rechargeable batteries. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), a class of framework materials possessing a 3D structure have gained vast interest as battery electrodes due to a rich and multiple redox active sites offering tunable chemistry to reversibly store charges. Albeit the Jahn\u2013Teller distortions, structural phase transitions, low electronic conductivity, and lattice degradation certainly restrict the practicality of PBAs, requiring a rational engineering to exploit their properties. This review exclusively focuses on engineering the physical\u2010chemical\u2010electrochemical properties of PBA via high configurational entropy and the role of HE\u2010PBA toward activating the redox centers and improving the structure, cycle stability, and conductivity are elaborated. The entropically tuned HE\u2010PBAs endow synergistic \u201ccocktail effect\u201d benefitting structural robustness, alleviated/controlled phase transitions, multi\u2010electron redox activity, and performance improvements in batteries including lithium\u2010ion (Li\u2010ion), sodium\u2010ion (Na\u2010ion), lithium\u2010sulfur (Li\u2010S) and zinc\u2010ion (Zn\u2010ion) chemistries and catalytic conversion reactions. Further, the structure\u2010property relationship of HE\u2010PBAs in energy storage and catalytic systems are systematically discussed underpinning the role of redox elements in capacity retention, structural stability, phases transition, and cycle\u2010life. Alongside, a prospect on the practical outcomes and scope for further improvements are detailed.",

    "content": "All\u2010solid\u2010state Li\u2013S and Na\u2013S batteries rely on complex solid\u2010state sulfur conversion governed by intertwined chemical interactions. This Perspective establishes a chemistry\u2010centered framework to elucidate sulfur transformation, S\u2013C, S\u2013SSE, and SSE\u2013C interactions, as well as their coupling during fabrication and cycling. Dissecting these intrinsic mechanisms reveals critical constraints and design principles for high\u2010loading, low\u2010pressure all\u2010solid\u2010state sulfur batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state Li\u2013S and Na\u2013S batteries (ASSSBs) employing highly conductive sulfide solid electrolytes combine high energy density with improved safety by enforcing solid\u2013solid sulfur conversion and eliminating polysulfide shuttling. However, sulfide electrolytes possess narrow electrochemical stability windows, while sulfur's low conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics, and \u223c80% volume change further challenge high\u2010loading (>30 wt.% S, or > 3\u00a0mg cm\u22122) operation under practical stack pressures. This perspective adopts an intrinsic chemical framework to dissect sulfur conversion in ASSSBs, emphasizing the coupled chemistry of sulfur, conductive carbon, and sulfide electrolytes during both fabrication and cycling. Sulfur redox pathways in liquid versus solid\u2010state systems are compared, followed by an analysis of electrolyte stability, S/electrolyte interactions, and interphase evolution. The differences in redox pathways for Li\u2013S vs Na\u2013S are discussed. Strategies to enhance sulfur reactivity and to tailor electrolyte behavior are then evaluated, culminating in design principles for high\u2010loading, low\u2010pressure ASSSBs capable of meeting practical performance targets.",

    "content": "An \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d effect is introduced by grafting Mg2+ ions onto the surface of triethoxy\u20103\u2010(2\u2010imidazolin\u20101\u2010yl)propylsilane (DI)\u2010bridged Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 fillers (LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg) to decouple Li+\u2010coordination in PEO\u2010based electrolytes. Lewis\u2010acidic Mg2+ can competitively chelate with EO chains and TFSI\u2212 anions, leading to a loosened Li+\u2010coordination for fast Li+ conduction. Moreover, TFSI\u2212 anions trapped by Mg2+ are preferentially decomposed, forming a stable LiF/Li3N\u2010rich SEI layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe strong and excessive Li+\u2010coordination with ethylene oxide (EO) chains induces\u00a0an inadequate Li+ conduction and poor interfacial stability in polyethylene oxide (PEO)\u2010based electrolytes. Herein, we introduce an \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d strategy to decouple Li+\u2010coordination by leveraging other metal ions to compete with Li+ for coordination. This design is realized by grafting Lewis\u2010acidic Mg2+ sites, which possess moderate positive charge and coordination ability, onto the surface of triethoxy\u20103\u2010(2\u2010imidazolin\u20101\u2010yl)propylsilane (DI)\u2010bridged Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 fillers (denoted as LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg). With the homogeneous dispersion of LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg within PEO matrix, Mg2+ sites readily chelate with EO and bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI\u2212) anions, inducing competitive Mg2+\u2010EO\u2010Li+ and Mg2+\u2010TFSI\u2212\u2010Li+ coordination structures. The resulting loosened Li+\u2010coordination environment enables high ionic conductivity (7.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121) and Li+ transference number (0.63), both essential for efficient ion transport in battery systems. Moreover, the preferentially formed Mg2+\u2010TFSI\u2212 promotes the generation of a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer enriched with LiF/Li3N, thereby improving interfacial stability. When applied in LiFePO4||Li and high\u2010voltage LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.1O2||Li full cells, the customized electrolyte demonstrates superior rate capability and long\u2010term cycling performance. This work highlights the significant potential of \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d effect in regulating Li+ conduction and tailoring interphase chemistry for high\u2010performance solid\u2010state composite electrolytes.",

    "content": "Lithium extraction from brines offers a promising pathway for future lithium supply, but its substantial water and energy demands hinder practical deployment and have received limited attention. This work quantitatively demonstrates that water-sustainable extraction is achievable by recovering freshwater during lithium concentration while also identifying the associated energy requirements and technical constraints. A solar-powered lithium-water cogeneration system is further proposed that integrates purification, concentration, and water recovery, enabling water- and energy-sustainable operation across the full extraction workflow.",

After conventional electrolyte dispensing and cell sealing, the precursor polymerizes around the separator to immobilize the solvent, suppress polysulfide crossover, and stabilize the cathode/electrolyte interphase. The gelled network delivers high Li+ transport while promoting uniform Li plating, improved cycling stability, and enhanced safety. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium\u2010sulfur (Li\u2010S) batteries offer a compelling alternative to conventional Li\u2010ion batteries, with their potential for higher energy density and greater sustainability. Despite active industrial efforts toward Li\u2013S commercialization and recent successes in niche markets, broader deployment remains limited by polysulfide shuttling, lithium\u2010metal instability, and the flammability of ether\u2010based liquid electrolytes. To address these limitations, a novel in\u2010situ gelled hybrid polymer\u2010ceramic electrolyte (GE), POSS\u2010PEG, is introduced, enabling facile fabrication and delivering high ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and enhanced safety. The POSS\u2010PEG GE significantly reduces polysulfide shuttling and enhances cycling stability compared to traditional liquid electrolyte (LE). Incorporation of the liquid electrolyte into the in situ cross\u2010linked polymeric network, together with the polar silsesquioxane core, promotes more uniform Li+ transport and reduces concentration gradients compared to conventional polymeric electrolytes. Operando and post\u2010mortem analyses indicate that the GE stabilizes both the S/C cathode\u2013electrolyte interface (CEI) and the Li metal anode, supporting efficient sulfur redox reactions and more uniform Li stripping/ deposition. Consequently, POSS\u2010PEG delivers improved electrochemical performance across various cell configurations, including pouch cells, maintaining capacity at high current rates and retaining function under mechanical stress. Overall, the POSS\u2010PEG GE offers a practical path toward safer and longer\u2010lasting Li\u2013S batteries.",

Yet their reversibility is fundamentally constrained by mechanistic challenges distinct from monovalent metal anode counterparts. The divalent charge of Mg2+ induces strong solvation, leading to large desolvation barriers, while its strong reducibility drives parasitic electrolyte decomposition. These coupled effects yield ion\u2010blocking passivation layers, hydrogen evolution, self\u2010corrosion, and morphological instability of Mg metal anodes. Building on these mechanistic insights, this review provides a mechanism\u2010driven perspective on Mg metal anodes: we delineate interfacial challenges in organic and aqueous electrolyte systems by dissecting the coupled roles of Mg2+ solvation\u2013desolvation, parasitic interfacial reactions, Mg plating/stripping kinetics, and mechanical evolution; on this basis, we articulate cross\u2010cutting design principles\u2014encompassing electrolyte formulation, artificial interfacial layers, alloying strategies, and 3D host architectures\u2014that balance suppression of parasitic pathways with efficient Mg2+ transport. Special attention is given to contrasting kinetic bottlenecks of organic electrolyte systems with thermodynamic constraints of aqueous media, and extracting unified design principles bridging these\u00a0two regimes.

    "content": "This work presents a manganese\u2010doped nickel hydroxide scaffold that anchors iridium as isolated single atoms (SAs) using a phytate ligand. The hierarchical nanoarray catalyst efficiently drives simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline media, enabling industrial\u2010level current densities and long\u2010term stability in an anion\u2010exchange\u2010membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE), while drastically reducing noble\u2010metal usage through tailored atomic\u2010level engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential to simplify electrode design and fabrication in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). However, most existing bifunctional catalysts suffer from poor stability and struggle to achieve high activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) simultaneously. Herein, we report Ir@Mn\u2013Ni\u2010PA, phytic acid\u2010modified Mn\u2010doped Ni layered double hydroxide catalyst that incorporates atomically dispersed Ir sites through tailored design of single atoms. Synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, the catalyst features hierarchical nanoarrays that enhance electron transport, mass diffusion, and hydrophilicity. Ir@Mn\u2013Ni\u2010PA exhibits excellent bifunctional activity, delivering low overpotentials of 65\u00a0mV for HER and 272\u00a0mV for OER at 10\u00a0mA cm\u22122, along with stability exceeding 100\u00a0h. When implemented in an AEMWE cell, it achieves a high current density of 1.64 A cm\u22122 at 2.0\u00a0V and remains stable for 300\u00a0h under industrially relevant conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ir atoms modulate the Mn\u2013Ni\u2010PA electronic structure, narrowing the bandgap and enhancing charge transfer, which improves water adsorption, dissociation, and catalytic activity. These results highlight the potential of atomic\u2010level engineering for designing durable, high\u2010performance bifunctional catalysts for sustainable energy conversion.",

This review outlines fundamental light\u2010driven and catalytic processes of CO2\u2010to\u2010formic acid conversion and demonstrates its key performance merits. Device configuration of various photoelectrochemical CO2\u2010to\u2010formic acid conversion systems is analyzed with their recent advancements and bottlenecks. Despite significant progress of these systems, studies confirm that practical deployment remains limited by insufficient power output from photoelectrodes that limits bias\u2010free operation, sluggish multi\u2010electron kinetics that suppress conversion rates, and complex device architecture that hinders long\u2010term and scale\u2010up operation. Engineering and operational limitations that prevent photoelectrodes from bias\u2010free operation, long\u2010term stability, and efficient solar\u2010to\u2010fuel conversion efficiency are then investigated, and strategies to overcome these limitations are outlined. Furthermore, engineering strategies of compact electrolyzers are discussed to perform CO2\u2010to\u2010formic acid conversion under high light\u2010intensity. Key considerations to overcome mass transport limitations and address downstream formic acid separation challenges are discussed to bridge gap between laboratory\u2010scale demonstrations and real\u2010world applications.",

Compared to optical modeling, the approach provides a substantially lower systematic error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) depends critically on the efficiency of exciton dissociation at donor\u2013acceptor interfaces, which is strongly influenced by the morphology. This work presents a method for quantifying the exciton dissociation efficiency leveraging the effect of thermally induced acceptor aggregation. The latter leads to an increase in the volume of pure domains, thereby hindering dissociation and increasing the recombination of excitons. As a result, the photocurrent decreases, while the photoluminescence (PL) of the non\u2010dissociated excitons increases. By correlating changes in absorptance, generated current and PL intensity over aging time, the method delivers robust estimates of the exciton dissociation efficiency, yielding 92.8% for the photoactive material PV\u2010X plus and 95.9% for PM6:DTY6 in their unaged state. The method also captures the decline in dissociation efficiency with aging, demonstrating that acceptor aggregation can become a significant performance\u2010limiting factor. Optical simulations of the device stacks reproduce the initial exciton dissociation efficiencies within their respective uncertainties, suggesting that exciton dissociation limits the internal quantum efficiency. However, the associated error margins are considerably larger, which underscores the enhanced accuracy of the proposed method and its suitability for diagnosing morphology\u2010related losses in OPV\u00a0performance.",

Here, N,N\u2010dimethylbenzenesulfonamide (DMBSA), a nonionic binary compound synthesized via a simple process, is applied as a defect passivation material.

Importantly, high\u2010voltage activation during the initial cycle successfully triggers the latent oxygen redox, and remarkably, enables full capacity recovery in subsequent cycles. This pre\u2010activation not only restores performance but also mitigates voltage decay and structural degradation over prolonged cycling. The Li1.2Mg0.1Ni0.1Mn0.6O2 delivers a discharge capacity of \u2248276.6 mAh g\u22121 and an energy density of \u2248902.2\u00a0Wh kg\u22121, with \u224893.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles.

In this study, a surface phase regulation strategy is presented that combines PEACl modification with chlorobenzene (CB)/ dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solution etching (CDSE) to precisely remove residual PbI2 and suppress the metastable 2D perovskite phase. The elimination of these parasitic phases enables the remaining PEA+ cations to form a 2D phase at grain boundaries (GBs), thereby modulating the electronic environment and aligning the energy levels between the perovskite absorber and the electron transport layer (ETL). This synergistic mechanism substantially reduces interfacial trap states and carrier recombination, resulting in wide\u2010bandgap perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.77% and excellent operational stability, maintaining 85% of the initial efficiency after 1600\u00a0h in an inert atmosphere. Furthermore, when integrated into two\u2010terminal (2T) mechanically stacked and monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem architectures, the optimized devices achieved efficiencies of 31.85% and 30.17% with enhanced stability. This work, therefore, provides a novel route toward the commercialization of high\u2010efficiency, stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.",

    "content": "The environmental sustainability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised by the potential leaching of toxic lead (Pb) components from degraded perovskite layers under harsh environmental stressors. Mitigating lead leakage throughout the entire life cycle is urgent for eco\u2010friendly PSCs. This review discusses the primary influence factors, according to the sequence of the crystal lattice, grain boundaries, film surfaces, charge transport layers, encapsulation layers, device recycling, and remanufacturing by element substitution, chemical fixation, physical encapsulation, and sustainable recycling utilization. Finally, a comprehensive summary and outlook on future development is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a leading third\u2010generation photovoltaic technology owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and tunable bandgap characteristics. However, the environmental sustainability of this technology is compromised by the potential leaching of toxic lead (Pb) from degraded perovskite layers under harsh environmental stressors. Such unintended Pb release poses substantial contamination risks to ecosystems and raises critical concerns regarding bio\u2010accumulative hazards. Consequently, mitigating lead leakage throughout the entire life cycle is urgent for eco\u2010friendly PSCs. Herein, we present a systematic review of the lead toxicity of PSCs and corresponding inhibition strategies. We discuss the primary influencing factors in sequence from the crystal lattice to grain boundaries, film surfaces, charge transport layers, encapsulation layers, device recycling, and remanufacturing. This article outlines two major strategies for preventing lead leakage: reducing lead usage through element substitution and protecting lead\u2010containing devices through chemical fixation, physical encapsulation, and sustainable recycling. Finally, we analyze the economy and operability of various strategies and look forward to future research directions. It is anticipated that through lead\u2010free designs and appropriate lead leakage inhibition strategies, the commercialization of PSCs will be further promoted.",

This synergistic effect not only optimizes the proton\u2010coupled electron transfer step but also balances the surface coverage of nitrate and protons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nTuning the adsorption behavior of key reaction intermediates is the crucial pathway for optimizing the performance of Cu\u2010based catalysts in electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. Constructing tandem catalytic sites by alloying to regulate the adsorption properties of nitrate and protons is regarded as a key approach to enhancing the performance of NH3\u2010oriented conversion. However, constructing the self\u2010tandem catalytic sites merely on the Cu surface remains a challenge. Here, we report a Cu\u2010based catalyst featuring unsaturated defect sites on its surface. This catalyst achieves an NH3 Faradaic efficiency approaching 92.37% and a production rate of 2.0\u00a0mmol cm\u22122 h\u22121 at \u22120.4\u00a0V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Through electrokinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopic investigation, and theoretical calculations, we reveal that this catalyst realizes efficient self\u2010tandem catalysis via its dual active sites, in which the Cu(111) facet serves as the active site for selective nitrate adsorption, while the engineered surface unsaturated defect sites promote water activation to supply protons. This synergistic effect not only optimizes the proton\u2010coupled electron transfer step (identified as the rate\u2010determining step) but also balances the surface coverage of nitrate and protons. These findings hold significant guiding implications for designing effective Cu\u2010based self\u2010tandem catalytic sites in electrochemical nitrate reduction.",

Modeling and outdoor testing verify reliable bidirectional thermal control, persistent sub\u2010ambient cooling, and scalable durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nIntensifying extreme weather increasingly exacerbates solar heating loads, leading to higher energy consumption, environmental stress, and thermal discomfort in urban and transportation settings. While passive radiative cooling offers a sustainable mitigation strategy, conventional materials suffer from static optical properties that lead to winter over\u2010cooling and poor seasonal adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we present a scalable, seasonally adaptive thermochromic composite film (TCF) capable of autonomous bidirectional thermal regulation. By embedding size\u2010optimized thermochromic microcapsules into a hierarchical porous poly(vinylidene fluoride\u2010co\u2010hexafluoropropylene) matrix, we engineer microstructure\u2010dependent Mie scattering to effectively decouple visible\u2013near\u2010infrared (vis\u2013NIR) modulation from long\u2010wave infrared (LWIR) emission.

Outdoor testing demonstrates stable cooling/heating capability and durability over 180 days. Produced via a scalable, meter\u2010scale continuous process, the TCF can be applied as a radiative\u2010cooling coating or integrated into functional textiles, providing year\u2010round adaptability for buildings, vehicles, and wearable systems. Overall, this work outlines a practical strategy for intelligent, energy\u2010saving materials capable of dynamically balancing heating and cooling for sustainable thermal management.",

The robust polymer network forms a uniform protective layer that suppresses electrolyte side reactions, resists internal stress fluctuations, and mitigates structural degradation, enabling durable high\u2010voltage operation and superior cycling stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nNi\u2010rich layered oxides and Li\u2010rich layered oxides are technologically important high\u2010capacity cathode materials for constructing high\u2010energy\u2010density batteries. However, their practical application is severely limited by interfacial instability and structural degradation during cycling.

Rationally designing the soft and hard domains of polyurethane endows PHM\u2010T with high mechanical strength, excellent electrolyte tolerance, and strong cathode affinity. When employed as a surface coating layer, PHM\u2010T acts as an artificial cathode electrolyte interphase and dramatically improves the structural and compositional stabilities of both Ni\u2010rich layered oxides and Li\u2010rich layered oxides.

Coupled with electro\u2010optical measurements and modeling, this has allowed us to construct the implied subcells' current\u2010voltage curves. The role of the narrow\u2010bandgap subcell as the primary contributor to the voltage gap has been demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010perovskite tandem solar cells with narrow and wide bandgap perovskite absorbers are promising candidates for low\u2010cost and high\u2010efficiency photovoltaic applications. However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the single\u2010junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional electro\u2010optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most toward the voltage gap, and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should focus on better growth and passivation strategies for the narrow band gap absorber.",

    "content": "This study demonstrates that Zn accelerates atomic ordering in L10\u2010PtCo by lowering vacancy formation energies and promoting vacancy\u2010mediated movements during annealing. Machine learning (ML) calculations reveal the critical role of Zn in this process, and the resulting ordered catalysts exhibit enhanced activity and durability, offering a rational route to practical oxygen reduction electrocatalysts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPromotion of atomic ordering in Pt\u2010based intermetallic compounds (IMCs) is a proven strategy to enhance catalytic activity and durability, for the cathode catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, achieving higher atomic ordering typically requires elevated temperature annealing, which induces nanoparticles (NPs) sintering and surface area loss, resulting in a challenge for catalyst design. Here, we demonstrate that Zn incorporation in L10\u2010PtCo IMCs promotes the ordering, endowing the enhanced stability and activity. Machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) simulations reveal that Zn lowers vacancy formation energies and modifies atomic migration, thereby accelerating ordering during annealing. These results are validated experimentally by X\u2010ray\u2010based analyses. Electrochemical measurements show that L10\u2010Zn\u2010PtCo/ZnNC achieves a mass activity (MA) of 1.76 A mgPt\u22121 at 0.9 VRHE, outperforming Pt/C (0.24 A mgPt\u22121). In single\u2010cell tests, it delivers 438\u00a0mA cm\u22122 at 0.7\u00a0V, surpassing Pt/C (293\u00a0mA cm\u22122). After 30\u00a0000 cycles, it retains 89.7% initial current density, compared with only 54.6% retention for Pt/C. By integrating ML\u2010guided design with experimental validation, this work establishes a rational strategy to engineer atomically ordered Pt\u2010based IMCs under practical conditions, advancing the development of efficient electrocatalysts.",

Here, using thermally annealed 3-nm-thick Ag coatings, lithium penetration into brittle electrolyte Li6.6La3Zr1.6Ta0.4O12 is inhibited at local current densities of 250\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 due to an increase in surface fracture toughness.",
