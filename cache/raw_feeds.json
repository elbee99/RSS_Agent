The forest line has moved upward since the 1850s, driven by the regional abandonment of grazing and the presence of the mountain pine. Despite the recent acceleration of this shift, the closed forest line has moved upward even faster."

    "content": "Abstract\nReliable paleotemperature proxies are essential for reconstructing past climate. To refine interpretation of the MBT'5ME index, based on bacterial brGDGT lipids, a year\u2010long study was conducted in Rotsee, Switzerland, a seasonally stratified lake with a 4\u201321\u00b0C temperature range. Suspended particulate matter was collected monthly from the epilimnion and the hypolimnion, complemented by surface sediments and surrounding soils. Both intact polar (IPL) and core lipid (CL) brGDGTs were analyzed alongside 16S rRNA gene data to disentangle environmental (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH) and biological (microbial community) controls on brGDGT compositions. In the stratified epilimnion, MBT'5ME values showed a muted response to summer warming (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.1), whereas the isomer ratio (IR) correlated more strongly with temperature (r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). MBT'5ME and IR were also significantly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), providing a novel diagnostic tool to identify sedimentary GDGTs derived from surface waters. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with pH (r\u00a0=\u00a00.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IR with dissolved oxygen (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.65 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Microbial DNA analysis revealed low Acidobacterial abundances (<0.4% of reads), suggesting MBT'5ME patterns are not solely driven by this phylum. Instead, hypolimnion IPL\u2010brGDGTs correlated with gene abundance of several other bacteria, indicating broader microbial contributions. Surface sediments reflected an integrated water column signal, while also showing evidence for additional in situ IPL\u2010brGDGT production. Overall, findings demonstrate that stratification onset drives MBT'5ME variability, while epilimnion temperature exerts stronger control on IR, refining their application in paleoclimate proxies."

    "content": "Abstract\nWetlandscapes\u2014networks of hydrologically connected wetlands\u2014can influence the transport and transformation of nutrients across watersheds. As climate change and human activity reshape wetland extent and connectivity, these landscape\u2010scale processes are being altered in ways that may intensify eutrophication in downstream lakes. We used Landsat\u2010derived inundation data (1984\u20132020) to evaluate how long\u2010term changes in wetlandscape properties have affected nutrient loading and phytoplankton bloom dynamics in Lake Winnipeg, Canada. Over this period, wetlands generally increased in number and size and exhibited greater connectivity to rivers and the lake but with declines observed after \u223c2015. These changes coincided with periods of substantial increases in the magnitude and spatial extents of phytoplankton blooms followed by declines in 2015 in the North Basin. Sub\u2010watersheds with shorter runoff travel distances to the lake showed stronger relationships between wetland connectivity and bloom metrics (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.10), suggesting reduced opportunity for nutrient retention and transformation. Incorporating runoff travel distance into wetlandscape assessments improved correlations with nutrient inputs and bloom extent. Rising surface temperatures further contributed to bloom intensification. These findings highlight how climate\u2010driven changes in wetland connectivity influence lake nutrient dynamics and demonstrate the potential for globally available satellite data to support spatially targeted water quality management."

    "content": "Abstract\nRecent advancements in remote sensing imagery classification have greatly improved monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics, deepening our understanding of their effects on ecosystems and terrestrial nutrient cycling. Forecasting LULC change remains challenging because it is strongly influenced by socioeconomic drivers and biogeochemical processes linked to land management and climate change. To address this complexity, a wide range of models has been developed, from process\u2010based to statistical approaches. Yet, comparisons at regional and global scales reveal large discrepancies, underscoring the need for more consistent calibration and validation with historical observations. Here, we leverage the increasing availability of annual LULC maps to evaluate the temporal performance of two independent data\u2010driven approaches: ARIMA time\u2010series forecasting and a deterministic Lotka\u2013Volterra ecological\u2010inspired model, across the R\u00edo de la Plata Grasslands, a threatened South American ecosystem. Both methods outperformed memoryless Markov chain models in capturing annual LULC transitions without requiring time\u2010consuming processing spatial inputs. These results demonstrate that incorporating long\u2010term annual LULC histories can substantially improve predictive skill and provide a robust framework for model intercomparison, with clear implications for linking land\u2010cover change to ecosystem and Earth system modeling."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change is now a reality, one that requires and will continue to require robust scientific information to guide mitigation and adaptation policies. Although this is true for all countries worldwide, low\u2010 and middle\u2010gross domestic product countries (LMGDP) face major technical, institutional, and financial barriers to producing such knowledge. These constraints limit their ability to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, define clear mitigation pathways, and design robust adaptation strategies. In contrast, freely available global scientific data are increasingly abundant. Open\u2010access resources from a wide range of institutions provide high\u2010quality climate and socioeconomic information at no cost. Leveraging these resources, combined with targeted capacity building and equitable international partnerships, offers a pathway to reduce research costs, avoid duplication, and strengthen policy\u2010relevant science in these countries. Addressing the paradox of global data abundance versus local data scarcity requires not only open data but open collaboration that integrates global expertise with local knowledge. In this commentary, two critical topics are employed to illustrate this challenge: (a) the calculation of reliable national GHG budgets essential for effective mitigation and (b) the development of adaptation pathways within nationally determined contributions. Strengthening national capacities while harnessing global data sets represents a crucial step toward enabling LMGDP countries to respond effectively to climate change."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe interannual variations of wintertime mixed layer depth (MLD) in the northern South China Sea (SCS), a region characterized by the deepest MLD within the basin and subduction process, are elucidated based on the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA, version 2.2.4) reanalysis data between 1950 and 2010. Our results reveal that the wintertime MLD possesses two predominant modes of 2\u20134\u2010year and 7\u20138\u2010year, involving different dynamical processes. Responses of thermal structure to local air\u2010sea interface factors primarily explain the 2\u20134\u2010year period MLD variability, with sea surface net heat flux playing a more crucial role than wind stress curl. Whereas for the 7\u20138\u2010year period MLD variability, Luzon Strait Transport (LST), high\u2010dense inflow from the Pacific Ocean into the northern SCS, is the dominant driver, while local air\u2010sea interface factors play a minor role. The difference between surface and subsurface layers inflow (\u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$), which is appropriate to represent the LST impact on vertical density gradient, can effectively modulate the upper layer stratification intensity in the northern SCS. Thus, a stronger (weaker) \u0394LST ${\\Delta }\\text{LST}$ conduces to establish a more unstable (stable) state therein, favorable to a vigorous (stagnant) vertical mixing and MLD deepening. Further analyses demonstrate the importance of both horizontal heat and salt advections related to LST in the northern SCS. That is to say, different from the 2\u20134\u2010year MLD variability, the salinity effect is of importance in driving this 7\u20138\u2010year MLD variability."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Southern Ocean plays a critical role in climate change while it remains incompletely understood due to lack of observations. This work utilizes the unique collection of temperature measurements from eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs) deployed along repeated transects together with the available Argo profiles across the Southern Ocean south of South Africa to examine long\u2010term temperature changes in this region. Summertime temperature sections in the upper 800\u00a0m were constructed along the XBT transect using 2,833 XBT and 1,631 Argo profiles during the period 2004\u20132020. The results show different temperature changes north and south of the Polar Front (PF): (a) north of the PF: warming from 2004/2005 to 2011/2012 and cooling from 2011/2012 to 2019/2020 in the top 300\u00a0m, which are linked to the wind field changes associated with the Southern Annual Mode, and meridional shifts of the PF and the Subantarctic Front; (b) south of the PF: consistent warming in the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) below 200\u00a0m and cooling above in the surface layer during the whole study period. The warming trend in the CDW is small but significant compared with the interannual variability. These temperature changes south of the PF might be due to the reduced vertical mixing caused by the freshening of the surface water induced by the increased sea ice melting. These findings improve understanding of observed temperature changes in the south of South Africa and provide means to establish a connection across the Southern Ocean."

    "content": "Abstract\nTidal mixing in the Kara Gates Strait (KGS) modulates transport of warm water from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea, playing a pivotal role in the transformation of Atlantic Water and the heat budget of the Arctic. Although previous studies have identified the presence of large\u2010amplitude internal waves by the interaction of M2 tidal currents with rough topography, understanding of the energetics and dynamics of M2 internal tides (ITs) in the KGS remains limited. Using a high\u2010resolution model, this study investigates the generation, propagation, and dissipation of M2 ITs. The results reveal that, in addition to the previously identified source in the central KGS, the slope of Vaygach Island serves as another major source of ITs with energy intensity exceeding that of the central strait. Background circulation confines the ITs within \u223c10\u00a0km off the slope forming atypical coastal trapped waves (CTWs). Theoretical solutions for these CTWs reveal a dominance of high vertical modes with energy dissipation exhibiting a \u201csandwich\u2010like\u201d structure. Applying the Lagrangian filtering, internal tides and lee waves along the KGS are separated. Dissipation associated with lee waves ranges from 10\u22127 to 10\u22126\u00a0W/kg comparable to those induced by ITs, yet their role in driving local mixing has been largely underestimated in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the dynamics around the KGS and their implications for Arctic tidal mixing processes."

The autonomous totivirus and its satellite can coexist but with an asymmetric dependence of the satellite on the totivirus for replication and maintenance inside the host cell. Satellites provide their yeast hosts with inhibitory toxins and the necessary self-immunity; loss of the satellite equates to loss of toxin immunity. Because these viral elements lack known extracellular stages, and sex is suspected to be rare, they are assumed to be transmitted vertically, implying that infection states should correlate with host genotypes. However, totivirus\u2013satellite coinfections are rarely examined in natural populations, leaving their associations with host genotypes poorly understood. We screened a multiyear, vineyard-associated population of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S. cerevisiae</span> isolates from New Zealand to examine the stability of host\u2013virus associations over time, both within and across genotypes. Over half of the wild isolates harbored infections (55%), but less than half of these (37% of infected) had toxin-encoding satellites. Genotypes that persisted across years typically maintained consistent infection states. However, we also observed stepwise transitions from coinfection through infection to an infection-free state, as well as acquisition of totiviruses and satellites. Genotypes clustered strongly by infection state, and population heterozygosity was significantly lower than expected, supporting vertical transmission while suggesting that outcrossing is not responsible for the acquisition of higher infection states. Despite occasional intragenotypic transitions, genotype clustering by infection state remained intact, suggesting that such transitions are transient and that host genotypes may have optimal infection states with regard to totiviruses and their satellites.</span>"

Despite their ecological and cultural significance, crocodilians are a taxon that remains underexplored in microbiome research. We investigated cloacal bacteriome samples from both wild and captive populations to identify compositional and functional differences resulting from captivity. Our findings reveal significant alterations in bacterial diversity and community structure in captive crocodiles, with notable shifts at both phylum and family levels; specifically, Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota dominate in captivity, whereas wild crocodiles exhibit a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota and Bacillota. The Shannon diversity index indicates a significant reduction in bacterial diversity among captive individuals, likely due to husbandry practices that foster a microbially depauperate environment. Additionally, serum metabolomics analysis shows an enrichment of alcohol sugars in captive crocodiles, alongside a decrease in pantothenic acid. While this is the first study to characterize these traits in saltwater crocodiles, further research is necessary to determine the physiological consequences of these bacterial and metabolic changes on host fitness and adaptability. Longitudinal studies are essential for understanding how bacterial communities evolve over time and in response to environmental factors, which will inform conservation strategies and improve the management of captive populations of crocodilians intended for reintroduction into the wild.</span>"

For Arctic lakes, increasing meltwater and precipitation may enhance the inputs of nutrients, organic matter and microorganisms from their catchments, and the increasingly ice-free, open-water conditions of the Arctic Ocean may favor increased inputs of marine aerosols, including microbiota. This study therefore aimed to determine how changing connectivity to terrestrial and marine habitats may affect the dispersal, sorting, and establishment of bacterial communities in a coastal High Arctic lake. Three habitats in this model system were sampled for ice, water, and snow: the lake, inflowing water tracks over permafrost soils, and an adjacent ice-dammed bay connected to the Arctic Ocean. Lake water chemistry confirmed the hydrological connection between the lake and terrestrial habitats, with the lake fed by terrestrial carbon sources via snow and groundwater run-off. Sequencing of 16S rDNA and rRNA showed evidence of a small marine and terrestrial influence on the lake, but few bacterial phylotypes were common to all three connected habitats. These results imply ongoing strong environmental filtering by habitat type, despite the apparent and potentially rising connectivity, and provide an example of bacterial resilience in a region of rapid climate change.</span>"

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nWe studied the drivers of population\u2010genetic structuring and genetic diversity in specialist parasites based on whole\u2010genome resequencing data from 82 Echinophthirius horridus seal louse individuals sampled from 12 ecologically and behaviourally different phocine seal species, subspecies and populations across the Holarctic. We found that the main genetic disjunctions in E. horridus lice occur across seal host species and subspecies, with a further level of population subdivision emerging among host individuals within some populations. Endemic and relict landlocked seal (sub)species host the genetically most distinct louse populations, while lice associated with sympatric marine seals show signatures of occasional gene flow across hosts. Within the latter, the most extreme case is seen in the near\u2010panmictic lice associated with northern European grey and harbour seals, which aggregate in shared rookeries and colonies. Although the louse and seal phylogenies were overall statistically significantly congruent, evidence for similar host shifts in the past is reflected in several conflicts in the phylogenetic trees of the lice and their hosts. Population\u2010level mean heterozygosity and theta in seal lice varied considerably, and both measures of genetic variation were statistically significantly related to host population size. Taken together, our results support a non\u2010adaptive model of parasite diversification, in which geographic and behavioural isolation among hosts drives parasite genetic differentiation, and genetic erosion in bottlenecked hosts cascades up to their specialist parasites. Our results provide new insights into processes that generate parasite diversity and trigger parallel losses of genetic diversity in endangered host\u2013parasite systems."

We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical <i>slow-fast dissection</i> method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations."

In contexts of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This paper presents extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary processes (such as birth) of the model directly from the data. We additionally incorporate a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process hyperparameters to the data.\nSeveral test cases are considered, demonstrating the method\u2019s performance for several standard models from population modeling, including age and size-structured models.

Here, we identify that BRCA1 protein stability is controlled through ubiquitin lysine 11 (K11)-linkage modification under the regulation of Cezanne deubiquitinating enzyme, APC/C E3 ligase, and Ube2S E2 conjugating enzyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cezanne-deficiency leads to increased BRCA1 K11-ubiquitination, decreased BRCA1 protein level, and increased cellular sensitivity to PARPi. The BRCA1 K11-linked ubiquitination is carried out through a degron on BRCA1 that is recognized by APC/C cofactor Cdh1. Tumor expression and mutational analyses indicate that Cezanne low or Ube2S high expression is associated with \u201cBRCAness\u201d and correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our study has demonstrated a ubiquitin K11-linked ubiquitination pathway that regulates BRCA1 protein stability, dysregulation of which predicts BRCA1-deficiency that may be effectively targeted with PARPi therapy."

Here, we studied how food supply and TOR signaling regulate the cell cycle in a multipotent population of Vasa2-/Piwi1-expressing cells in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signaling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signaling activation and S-phase re-entry, and led to a global decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells. This strongly suggests that <i>Nematostella</i> Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, a phenomenon previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture. The nutritional control of quiescence and cell proliferation may thus be a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved strategy underlying the environmental regulation of indeterminate growth in animals."

Here, we used Sf9 cells to express HCAR3-Gi and HCAR2-Gi complexes, and present cryo-EM structures of HCAR3-Gi complexes with agonists compound 6O (3.31 \u00c5), D-phenyllactic acid (3.05 \u00c5), IBC293 (3.26 \u00c5), and acifran (3.18\u00c5), as well as HCAR2-Gi complex with agonist acifran (2.72 \u00c5). Our findings reveal the mechanism behind 6O\u2019s highest affinity to HCAR3, attributed to its full occupation of both R1 and R2 regions of the orthosteric binding pocket. Moreover, combined with cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells, we have elucidated that the ligand selectivity between HCAR3 and HCAR2 depended on <i>\u03c0</i>\u2013<i>\u03c0</i> interaction with F107<sup>3.32</sup> (L107<sup>3.32</sup> in HCAR2) and ligand-binding pocket size difference, facilitated by key residues difference V/L83<sup>2.60</sup>, Y/N86<sup>2.63</sup>, and S/W91<sup>23.48</sup>. Collectively, these structural insights lay the groundwork for developing HCAR3-specific drugs, potentially avoiding HCAR2-induced adverse effects."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104242",
    "content": "Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC), repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles, indicating high trial-by-trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation in awake mice to study how increased activity of single cells affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched their tuning property, while non-co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results show that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent."

    "content": "Abstract\nDeep long\u2010period (DLP) earthquakes have been observed at many volcanic settings around the world and linked to the magmatic processes that drive volcanic unrest. At the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) of the Cascade arc, limited detection of DLP activity hinders classification of anomalous seismic behavior and its relationship to the LVC magmatic system. This study uses a template matching approach with seismic data from temporary nodal and permanent stations to detect and locate DLP earthquakes near the LVC between 2017 and 2024. Within the DLP catalog of 611 events, a transition occurs from scattered (2017\u20132020) to oscillatory (2021\u20132024) occurrence rates. During the oscillatory period, regional earthquakes with large amplitude velocity waveforms observed near the LVC are associated with abrupt changes in DLP occurrence rates. Continued monitoring of DLP activity has the potential to better define the processes that drive volcanic unrest at the LVC in the future."

    "content": "Abstract\nUncorrected long\u2010wavelength contributions remain a major limitation for interpreting InSAR time\u2010series over large areas (>100\u00a0km). Among them, the ionosphere can impact InSAR measurements across various timescales, potentially biasing secular velocity estimates. We use Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) to predict ionospheric effects for >15,000 Sentinel\u20101 acquisitions in France, Tibet, and Central Andes. We evaluate GIM\u2010based corrections using phase ramps (planar functions fitted to interferograms) as proxies for long\u2010wavelength signals, enabling analysis of their temporal evolution. After correcting for solid Earth tides and oceanic tidal loading, GIM\u2010derived predictions show a strong temporal consistency with observed ramps, effectively capturing seasonal and multi\u2010year fluctuations with amplitudes of \u223c ${\\sim} $0.2\u00a0mm/km. The highest\u2010resolution GIM also corrects part of the strong daily fluctuations of along\u2010track ramps observed on ascending tracks over equatorial regions. These corrections reduce ramp rate uncertainty and improve agreement with GNSS, paving the way toward direct InSAR measurement of tectonic plate motion."

Using the combined COSMIC\u2010Arase data set, we provide a convenient way to reconcile the two regions in empirical models based on the analytical Chapman function inversion for scale height.

However, the geomagnetic reversal pattern during the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition remains elusive. Here we present an integrated magneto\u2010 and cyclo\u2010stratigraphic study of a \u223c1.8\u2010Myr\u2010long, late Ediacaran succession in Newfoundland, Canada. We obtained a reversal frequency of 10\u201312\u00a0Myr\u22121, documenting a hyperactively reversing geodynamo during the late Ediacaran. Together with the updated reversal records and paleointensity data sets, we propose a >70\u2010Myr\u2010long interval of geomagnetic reversal hyperactivity before the Ordovician Reversed Superchron, forming a hyperactivity\u2010superchron couplet that recurs in the mid\u2010Paleozoic and Mesozoic.

    "content": "Abstract\nReservoirs provide key water storage in regions facing projected water scarcity and population growth. Many reservoirs experience water level fluctuations including periods of drawdown tied to drought. To examine sensitivity of water clarity to drawdown, we compiled 30\u00a0years of water level and Secchi depth measurements in southern Great Plains reservoirs (n\u00a0=\u00a084) positioned across a climate gradient from the arid west to the wetter east. Mixed\u2010effect models incorporated reservoir\u2010specific coefficients relating Secchi depth to water storage volume. Predictions from the best model indicated that many reservoirs lost more than half of their Secchi depth as water levels approached their recorded lows. Reservoirs in west and central Texas tended to experience more severe drawdown and more pronounced loss of water clarity during drawdown. These results show that droughts can cause a dual setback in which the loss of water quantity coincides with loss of water quality in reservoirs."

We present petrological and geochemical analyses of six very\u2010low\u2010Ti (VLT) basalt fragments from Chang'e\u20106 (CE6) samples. These basalts yield a Pb\u2010Pb age of around 2.9\u00a0Ga, representing the youngest reported VLT volcanism. They are slightly older than the low\u2010Ti basalts from the same soils and exhibit distinct pyroxene compositions and 238U/204Pb ratios, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Compared to Apollo and Luna VLT basalts, these samples share similarly depleted Sr\u2010Pb isotopes but display elevated rare earth element concentrations and TiO2 contents. These basalts most likely derived from low\u2010degree melting of an olivine\u2010orthopyroxene source followed by 30%\u201340% fractional crystallization. Further diffusion chronometry reveals rapid magma ascent from magma chamber to surface, likely facilitated by the thin lunar crust resulting from the South Pole\u2010Aitken basin\u2010forming impact.

Based on radar interferometry over a large field\u2010of\u2010view, the BSL was revealed to occur over a limited area northeastward of the radar and did not cause scintillation when Global Navigation Satellite System satellites passed through. The BSL vertical displacement precisely followed the F\u2010layer bottom fluctuation, without obvious horizontal movement. Interestingly, the localized BSL caused weak spread\u2010F traces in the ionograms indicating irregularities from specific directions, which are distinct from the satellite traces or range spread F related to plasma bubble development thus could serve as a new signature of BSL in future studies."

    "content": "Mammalian liver metabolism undergoes a substantial shift during fasting. Thermodynamic principles impose fundamental constraints on metabolism, and the Gibbs free energy change of reaction ({Delta}_r G) indicates the reaction direction and distance from equilibrium. However, {Delta}_r G landscapes in intact mammalian organs remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we mapped {Delta}_r G^' profile of glucose metabolism in mouse liver during fasting, using experimentally measured absolute metabolite concentrations and a newly developed computational method, GLEAM. We found that despite large metabolite fluctuations during fasting, the corresponding {Delta}_r Gs remained robust, even for reactions reversing the direction between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. A remarkable thermodynamic robustness is found in maintaining potential candidates of rate-limiting steps during fasting. This robustness is achieved by expending substantial costs for enzyme expressions, contributing to efficient switching from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, obese mouse liver also showed thermodynamic robustness despite obesity-induced metabolic disruption. Our framework provided a novel thermodynamic perspective on intact organ metabolism, demonstrating that the liver robustly maintains thermodynamic characteristics favorable for metabolic control by buffering metabolite concentration differences."

    "content": "Organisation and dynamics of chromatin play a key role in regulation of cell state and function. In cancer, chromatin plasticity is known to be important in control of drug resistance, but the relationship between chromatin compaction and chemotherapy response within complex tissue settings remains unclear. Here, we measured single nuclei chromatin compaction using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in situ in whole biopsies from 53 pre treatment and 14 post surgery tissue samples of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients to determine whether single nuclei spatial chromatin compaction state can predict resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Bulk chromatin compaction across 53 pre-treatment core biopsies did not predict patient outcome. However, machine learning analysis revealed that a subset of patients exhibited distinct distributions of single nuclei with more open chromatin states, which was predictive of NACT-resistance. Graph neural network analysis established that the spatial arrangement of chromatin compaction contributed to prediction of NACT resistance and that chromatin compaction signatures were preserved in tissue state transitions from pre- to 14 post-NACT samples. Our findings shed new light on spatial control of chromatin structure and relationship to therapeutic resistance and establish a foundation for further molecular analysis of chromatin states in complex biological tissues."

    "content": "Background: Alterations in amine metabolism have been implicated Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are key biofluids in AD research. CSF is considered to better reflect brain metabolic alterations than plasma, while plasma can be obtained more easily. However, plasma-CSF relationships are unclear. Aim: To investigate longitudinal changes of amines in plasma and CSF, and their correlation across the two, in male and female TgF344 AD transgenic versus wildtype (WT) rats. Method: LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics was used to analyze 60 and 55 amines in plasma and CSF, respectively, of male and female TgF344-AD and WT rats, at 12, 25, 50 and 85 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized logistic regressions, Pearson correlations, and differential correlations between groups and matrixes. Results: Compared to WT controls, at 12 weeks, TgF344-AD rats showed an increase of 3-methylhistidine, anserine, cysteine, s-methylcysteine, while at 25 weeks, male TgF344-AD rats showed pronounced increases in CSF levels of alpha-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, glycylglycine, glycylproline, histidine, isoleucine, kynurenine, leucine, methionine, methionine sulfone, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, and valine. At 50 weeks, female TgF344-AD rats exhibited reductions in CSF for DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, and putrescine. Distinct plasma-CSF correlations were found for 1-methylhistidine, 2-aminoadipic acid, putrescine, kynurenine, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-lysine, DL-3-aminoisobutyric acid, and taurine, particularly in TgF344-AD rats. Conclusions: Body fluid, age- and sex-dependent amine alterations in CSF and plasma of TgF344-AD rats compared to WT controls provide important insights into AD disease processes and may aid early diagnosis and therapeutic targeting."

    "content": "The CRISPR-dCas9 system has emerged as a versatile platform for programmable gene regulation, offering unique advantages in modularity and orthogonality for constructing synthetic genetic circuits. Here, we present a novel architecture for biomolecular neural networks based on dCas9, guide RNAs, and antisense RNA sequestration. Through mathematical modeling and steady-state analysis, we demonstrate that this system functions as a molecular perceptron with a threshold activation function analogous to a saturated rectified linear unit (ReLU). However, a critical challenge in scaling these circuits is competition for the finite dCas9 pool, whose expression must remain low to avoid cytotoxicity. We address this constraint by developing a resource-aware design framework and characterizing how shared dCas9 availability affects network performance. Our results show that for classification tasks, decision boundaries remain invariant under resource competition, while for regression tasks, node thresholds are preserved despite sensitivity in output magnitude under heterogeneous binding conditions. We demonstrate the computational capabilities of this platform through both linear and nonlinear classification problems, as well the approximation of a band-pass function as a proof-of-concept regression task. This work expands the repertoire of molecular mechanisms capable of computation and establishes design principles for implementing CRISPR-based neuromorphic circuits that can execute complex computational tasks within the biochemical constraints of living cells."

    "content": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as key signaling intermediates in plant metabolism, defense, and stress adaptation. In photosynthetic organisms, chloroplast and mitochondria serve as the major hubs of ROS production, thereby coordinating stress responses across cellular compartments. However, the extent of cross-organellar communication following compartmentalized oxidative stress remains poorly understood. Using C. reinhardtii as a model system, we induced compartmentalized oxidative stress in chloroplast and mitochondria to investigate whether the ROS generation in one organelle triggers any functional response in the other organelle. Methyl viologen (MV) was used to induce ROS production in the chloroplast, while menadione (MD) was used to trigger mitochondrial ROS production. Real-time monitoring of compartment-specific roGFP strains showed specific, localized, and reversible ROS production following MV and MD treatment as a function of time within the respective target organelles. Comprehensive functional analyses following compartmentalized ROS perturbations revealed that the mitochondrial ROS remained localized to their site of origin and did not detectably affect chloroplast function, as evidenced by the unchanged chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and photosystem stoichiometry. In contrast, chloroplast-derived ROS diffused from its site of origin and transiently suppressed the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Together, these findings underscore a dynamically regulated system, where chloroplast ROS leaks out and affects mitochondrial function while the mitochondrial ROS remains localized and does not impact chloroplast function. These compartment-specific ROS responses likely represent an adaptive mechanism for coordinating cellular energy metabolism in response to fluctuating environmental conditions."

    "content": "Members of the class Ktedonobacteria (phylum Chloroflexota) are widespread across a variety of terrestrial environments. They are particularly enriched in silica-rich oligotrophic caves, where they may act as early colonizers, but the genomic bases supporting this pioneering capacity are still unclear. Here, we present a systematic genomic analysis of Ktedonobacteria from diverse ecosystems, with a focus on oligotrophic caves. Cave Ktedonobacteria belong to novel genera of Ktedonobacteraceae and harbor genes supporting a mixotrophic metabolism that combines the use of organic and inorganic substrates as energy and carbon sources. Comparative analyses of all available Ktedonobacteria genomes from diverse environments showed that most metabolic traits, including those enabling atmospheric gas oxidation, are primarily driven by taxonomy. In contrast, genes involved in CO2; fixation are enriched in Ktedonobacteria inhabiting caves. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the RuBisCO of Ktedonobacteria likely represents a novel Form I subtype, which we designate as BAK, reflecting its wide occurrence in thermophilic and acidophilic Bacillota and Actinomycetota inhabiting similar extreme environments. The presence of this subtype across distinct lineages in comparable habitats suggests that it may confer a selective advantage in nutrient-poor settings (like caves) and that its distribution may be subject to horizontal gene transfer. This autotrophic capacity relies on a transaldolase variant of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle that was previously described only in one Firmicutes species. Overall, this study provides genetic evidence supporting the combination of atmospheric gas oxidation with dark CO2; fixation in Ktedonobacteria, highlighting their role as primary producers in oligotrophic ecosystems, including caves."

Within the harbor, five distinct sedimentary facies were identified, each displaying unique sediment characteristics and patterns of organic carbon burial. Mud\u2010rich, low\u2010energy facies, including rippled and bioturbated muds, consistently showed higher organic carbon density and burial rates compared to sandy, more dynamic facies. Estimated carbon stocks in the upper meter of sediment range from 44 to 120\u00a0t\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121, comparable to or exceeding those of many vegetated coastal habitats. Temporal changes in facies distribution driven by estuarine processes and variations in sediment supply led to significant long\u2010term fluctuations in organic carbon burial.

FLUXNET is a global network of regional eddy covariance networks that measure ecosystem\u2010scale exchanges of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, H2O) and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere. MexFlux is the eddy covariance network of Mexico, a megadiverse country with many underrepresented ecosystems within FLUXNET. This study evaluates the spatial representativeness of MexFlux by assessing its ability to capture the statistical and spatial heterogeneity of annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) within Mexico. We tested four network configurations: the historical distribution of MexFlux sites (MexFlux\u2010H, n\u00a0=\u00a033), an expanded network with 20 additional sites (MexFlux\u00a0+\u00a020, 53 sites), MexFlux sites with publicly available data (MexFlux\u2010P, n\u00a0=\u00a020), and a hypothetical optimized design with only 25 sites (MexFlux25, n\u00a0=\u00a025). Results show that MexFlux\u2010H and MexFlux\u2010P overrepresent regions with GPP values between 250 and 600 gC m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121 and ET of 200\u20131,200\u00a0mm\u00a0yr\u22121. MexFlux\u00a0+\u00a020 demonstrates that adding 20 strategically located sites improves the representativeness of MexFlux while preserving the historical distribution of the network. The configuration of MexFlux25 highlights that a few but strategically distributed sites are an alternative way to enhance the representativeness of the network. Mountain regions, tropical forests, and urban sites may remain underrepresented in any network configuration, highlighting the challenges of monitoring efforts in this country. Our framework integrates distributions, copulas, semivariograms, and upscaling to highlight the value of a multidimensional assessment of spatial representativeness, which applies to other regional FLUXNET networks."

    "content": "Abstract\nNitrate discharge via stream water is a key indicator of how disturbances influence forest nutrient cycling. In a temperate forest in central Japan, 35\u00a0years of hydrological, biogeochemical, and plant uptake monitoring revealed sustained nitrate leaching for over 25\u00a0years following red pine dieback due to pine wilt disease in 1989\u20131990. Stream nitrate concentrations followed three distinct phases: (I) a rapid rise and decline (1990\u20132000), (II) a gradual decrease (2000\u20132010), and (III) a slight increase stabilizing above pre\u2010dieback levels (post\u20102010). Phase I was driven by changes in soil nitrate production following pine mortality. In Phase II, prolonged low rainfall accelerated declines in NO3\u2212 concentrations. During Phase III, natural mortality of stressed cypress trees (2008\u20132015) coincided with a decline in nitrogen uptake of up to 65.7\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121, likely contributing to renewed nitrate leaching. Field experiments demonstrated that plant growth conditions strongly influenced catchment\u2010scale nitrogen dynamics. Shifts in soil microbial activity were associated with climate variability and changes in vegetation. Notably, the effects of plant mortality on nitrate leaching were delayed, with several years separating disturbance events and hydrological responses. These findings highlight the importance of long\u2010term monitoring to capture delayed and complex responses of nutrient cycling to ecosystem disturbances, integrating approaches such as dual isotope analyses, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and vegetation uptake."

    "content": "Abstract\nOcean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a marine carbon dioxide (CO2) removal strategy that relies on lowering the ocean's pCO2 via the addition of alkaline materials to facilitate enhanced CO2 uptake with the potential for durable, long\u2010term, storage. This strategy has gained recent scientific and private sector attention as a possible component of climate mitigation portfolios, yet many research questions remain. This work describes an analysis of historical reconstructions of regional carbonate chemistry developed via application of machine learning algorithms to an ocean reanalysis product. Model skill assessment demonstrated excellent performance when compared to regional observations, and this work focuses on four carbonate system variables that may influence OAE applications: total scale pH, calcite saturation state, the theoretical molar change in dissolved inorganic carbon associated with a molar change in total alkalinity (\u0394DIC/\u0394TA), and the timescale of CO2 equilibrium of the surface mixed layer (\u03c4CO2 ${\\tau }_{{\\text{CO}}_{2}}$). These metrics were combined into a suitability index to quantify locations and times of year more favorable for OAE. Much of the US Northeast Shelf and Slope region has seasonally similar suitability for small\u2010scale OAE applications, with nearshore environments exhibiting high suitability year\u2010round. Lagrangian particle tracking experiments show strong reductions in \u0394DIC/\u0394TA and increases in \u03c4CO2 ${\\tau }_{{\\text{CO}}_{2}}$ due to horizontal and vertical transport, suggesting that when water motion is accounted for, reduced efficiency and longer equilibration times may impact successful observations of carbon uptake and storage. This analysis and framework were developed with publicly available tools, data sets, and global data products allowing for global scalability and application."

    "content": "Abstract\nStress\u2013strain relationships are fundamental to understanding deformation mechanics in any material. In sea ice, stress\u2013strain relationships are typically observed by measuring the strain resulting from known stress in samples wholly or partially isolated from the surrounding ice. Such observations show sea ice behaves elastically at short timescales, and the effective parameters describing this elastic behavior vary with temperature, salinity, and strain rate. However, these experiments often employ larger strain rates than are typical for intact, in situ ice, are labor intensive, and are typically limited to meter scale. Here we utilize a novel synthesis of existing observation techniques to quantify the effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of a km\u2010scale area of heterogeneous, drifting sea ice surrounding the Sea Ice Dynamics Experiment (SIDEx) drifting ice camp in the Beaufort Sea. In\u2010ice point measurements of two\u2010dimensional horizontal stress from an array of 31 vibrating wire stress gauges (VWSG), distributed over a \u223c1.5\u00a0km radius area, allow us to observe natural forcing conditions. A ground\u2010based interferometric radar provides contemporaneous one\u2010dimensional surface strain measurements collocated with stress within 22.5\u00a0m resolution cells. We find an effective elastic modulus of 2.4\u00a0\u00b1 $\\mathit{\\pm }$\u00a00.6\u00a0GPa and effective Poisson's ratio of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1 $\\mathit{\\pm }$\u00a00.2 describe the heterogeneous, mixed multi\u2010 and first\u2010year ice within the area of the VWSG array. These values are broadly consistent with prior laboratory and field experiments while offering a novel point of reference for real\u2010world sea ice deformation behavior under natural conditions."

However, the bioinformatic analyses and interpretation of population genomic datasets can be daunting and difficult to convey to nonspecialists, including on\u2010the\u2010ground conservationists that work with many state, federal and international agencies. We think that individual population genomic metrics of interest can be interpolated and ultimately distilled into thematic GIS layers that represent spatiotemporal genomic potential (or conversely, susceptibility) in conservation monitoring. As examples relevant to ongoing conservation efforts, we use introgressive hybridisation and individual heterozygosity to illustrate a conceptual approach for mapping population genomic susceptibility. The general framework of thematic layers could be extended to integrate key genomic metrics (e.g., runs of homozygosity and genomic load) that are relevant to many conservation efforts."

In ecology and evolutionary biology, findings, funding and research effort are disproportionately concentrated at high latitudes, while biological diversity is concentrated at low latitudes. This discrepancy may have a particular influence in fields like phylogeography, molecular ecology and conservation genetics, where the rise of genomics has increased the cost and technical expertise required to apply state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods. Here, we ask whether a fundamental biogeographic pattern\u2014the latitudinal gradient of species richness in tetrapods\u2014is reflected in the available reference genomes, an important data resource for various applications of molecular tools for biodiversity research and conservation. We also ask whether sequencing approaches differ between the Global South and Global North, reviewing the last 5\u2009years of conservation genetics research in four leading journals. We find that extant reference genomes are scarce relative to species richness at low latitudes and that reduced representation and whole\u2010genome sequencing are disproportionately applied to taxa in the Global North. We conclude with recommendations to close this gap and improve international collaborations in biodiversity genomics."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii, is a large, long\u2010lived marine mollusc that inhabits rocky intertidal habitats along the coast of California and Mexico. In 1985, populations were impacted by a bacterial disease known as withering syndrome (WS) that wiped out >90% of individuals, leading to the closure of all U.S. black abalone fisheries since 1993. Current conservation strategies include restoring diminished populations by translocating healthy individuals. However, population collapse on this scale may have dramatically lowered genetic diversity and strengthened geographic differentiation, making translocation\u2010based recovery contentious. Additionally, the current prevalence of WS remains unknown. To address these uncertainties, we sequenced and analysed the genomes of 133 black abalone individuals from across their present range. We observed no spatial genetic structure among black abalone, with the exception of a single chromosomal inversion that increases in frequency with latitude. Outside the inversion, genetic differentiation between sites is minimal and does not scale with either geographic distance or environmental dissimilarity. Genetic diversity appears uniformly high across the range. Demographic inference does indicate a severe population bottleneck beginning just 15 generations in the past, but this decline is short lived, with present\u2010day size far exceeding the pre\u2010bottleneck status quo. Finally, we find the bacterial agent of WS is equally present across the sampled range, but only in 10% of individuals. The lack of population genetic structure, uniform diversity and prevalence of WS bacteria indicates that translocation could be a valid and low\u2010risk means of population restoration for black abalone species' recovery."

    "content": "Abstract\nPopulation genomics analysis holds great potential for informing conservation of endangered populations. We focused on a controversial case of European whitefish (Coregonus spp.) populations. The endangered North Sea houting is the only coregonid fish that tolerates oceanic salinities and was previously considered a species (C. oxyrhinchus) distinct from European lake whitefish (C. lavaretus). However, no firm evidence for genetic\u2010based salinity adaptation has been available. Also, studies based on microsatellite and mitogenome data suggested surprisingly recent divergence (c. 2500\u2009years bp) between houting and lake whitefish. These data types furthermore have provided no evidence for possible inbreeding. Finally, a controversial taxonomic revision recently classified all whitefish in the region as C. maraena, calling conservation priorities of houting into question. We used whole\u2010genome and ddRAD sequencing to analyse six lake whitefish populations and the only extant indigenous houting population. Demographic inference indicated post\u2010glacial expansion and divergence between lake whitefish and houting occurring not long after the Last Glaciation, implying deeper population histories than previous analyses. Runs of homozygosity analysis suggested not only high inbreeding (FROH up to 30.6%) in some freshwater populations but also FROH up to 10.6% in the houting prompting conservation concerns. Finally, outlier scans provided evidence for adaptation to high salinities in the houting. Applying a framework for defining conservation units based on current and historical reproductive isolation and adaptive divergence led us to recommend that the houting be treated as a separate conservation unit regardless of species status. In total, the results underscore the potential of genomics to inform conservation practices, in this case clarifying conservation units and highlighting populations of concern."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nArtificial propagation and wild release may influence the genetic integrity of wild populations. This practice has been prevalent in fisheries for centuries and is often termed \u2018stocking\u2019. In the Laurentian Great Lakes (Great Lakes here\u2010on), walleye populations faced declines from the 1950s to the 1970s, prompting extensive stocking efforts for restoration. By the mid\u20102010s, walleye populations showed signs of recovery, but the genetic legacy of stocking on population structure at the genomic level remains unclear. Using a dataset of 45,600 genome\u2010aligned SNP loci genotyped in 1075 walleye individuals, we investigated the genetic impacts of over 50\u2009years of stocking across the Great Lakes. Population structure was associated with both natural geographic barriers and stocking from non\u2010native sources. Admixture between Lake Erie walleye and walleye from the re\u2010populated Tittabawassee River indicate that stocking may have re\u2010distributed putatively adaptive alleles around the Great Lakes. Genome scans identified FST outliers and evidence of selective sweeps, indicating local adaptation of spawning populations is likely. Notably, one genomic region showed strong differentiation between Muskegon River and walleye from the Tittabawassee River, which was re\u2010populated by Muskegon strain walleye, suggesting admixture and selection both impact the observed genetic diversity. Overall, our study underscores how artificial propagation and translocations can significantly alter the evolutionary trajectory of populations. The findings highlight the complex interplay between stocking practices and population genetic diversity, emphasising the need for careful management strategies to preserve the genetic integrity of wild populations amidst conservation efforts."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe recently extirpated Zanzibar leopard was the only known African leopard (Panthera pardus spp.) population restricted exclusively to a major island habitat. Although its demise was driven through habitat change and conflict with humans, given its role as a keystone species for the Zanzibar Archipelago, its successful potential reintroduction might offer a means for helping preserve the natural biodiversity of its former habitat. Whether this is feasible, however, would be contingent on both whether closely related source populations can be identified on mainland Africa, and whether the Zanzibar form exhibited any special adaptations that might need to be considered when choosing such a source. In light of these questions, we genomically profiled two of the six known historic specimens, to explore whether they represent a realistic candidate for de\u2010extirpation through reintroduction. Our analyses indicate that despite its geographical separation, the Zanzibar leopard shared a close genetic relationship with mainland East African individuals. Furthermore, although its uniqueness as an island population was emphasised by genomic signatures of high inbreeding and increased mutation load, the latter similar to the level of the critically endangered Amur leopard (P. p. orientalis), we find no evidence of functionally significant genetic diversity unique to Zanzibar. We therefore conclude that should attempts to restore leopards to Zanzibar be considered, then mainland East African leopards would provide a suitable gene pool."

Consequently, there has been a surge in European restoration efforts, many of which focus on restocking as a conservation measure. In this study, we used whole\u2010genome sequencing (WGS) data to investigate the population structure, demographic history, and patterns of local adaptation of O. edulis across its natural distribution with increased sampling densities at Scandinavian localities. Results revealed seven distinct genetic clusters, including previously undescribed complex population structure in Norway, and evidence for introgression between genetic clusters in Scandinavia. We detected large structural variants (SVs) on three pseudo\u2010chromosomes. These megabase long regions were characterised by strong linkage disequilibrium and clear geographical differentiation, suggestive of chromosomal inversions potentially associated with local adaptation. The results indicated that genomic traces of past translocations of non\u2010native O. edulis were still present in some individuals, but overall, we found limited evidence of major impacts of translocations on the scale of contemporary population structure. Our findings highlight the importance of considering population structure and signatures of selection in the design of effective conservation strategies to preserve and restore wild native European flat oyster populations, and we provide direct knowledge safeguarding sustainable mitigation actions in this important species."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nSpecies with extremely small population sizes are critically endangered because of reduced genetic diversity, increased inbreeding and hybridisation threats. Genomic tools significantly advance conservation by revealing genetic insights into endangered species, notably in monitoring frameworks. Sicilian fir (Abies nebrodensis) is the most endangered conifer in Europe with only 30 adult trees in an 84\u2010ha area. Using 20,824 SNPs from RAD\u2010seq, employing genome assembly and a custom 120 SNP\u2010array, we evaluated genetic diversity, mating patterns, and effective population size in adult trees, 118 natural seedlings, and 2064 nursery seedlings from past conservation actions. We assessed introgression from neighbouring non\u2010native fir plantations (~6%) and established an intra\u2010population assisted gene flow (AGF) program selecting the most genetically dissimilar individuals and investigating the outcome through simulations. Genomic analysis unveiled significant genetic diversity among adult Sicilian firs, comparable to non\u2010endangered Mediterranean firs with larger populations. However, the genetic diversity of the forthcoming generation declined due to high self\u2010fertilisation, leading to marked inbreeding (FIS\u2009=\u20090.38) and an alarmingly low effective population size (Ne\u2009=\u20096). Nursery seedling monitoring revealed similar selfing rates and introgression (~2%) from non\u2010native firs. Although intra\u2010population AGF could help to mitigate genetic loss, it may not alleviate the species vulnerability to imminent environmental challenges, perpetuating the risk of an extinction vortex. Hence, investigating the impact of Sicilian fir population decline and selfing on inbreeding depression, along with exploring the potential of hybrids for genetic load alleviation and future adaptation, is crucial for effective conservation strategies."

    "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.17604?af=R",
    "content": "ABSTRACT\nWeedy rice is a close relative of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) that infests rice fields worldwide and drastically reduces yields. To combat this agricultural pest, rice farmers in the southern US began to grow herbicide\u2010resistant (HR) rice cultivars in the early 2000s, which permitted the application of herbicides that selectively targeted weedy rice without harming the crop. The widespread adoption of HR rice coincided with increased reliance on hybrid rice cultivars in place of traditional inbred varieties. Although both cultivated and weedy rice are predominantly self\u2010fertilising, the combined introductions of HR and hybrid rice dramatically altered the opportunities and selective pressure for crop\u2010weed hybridization and adaptive introgression. In this study, we generated genotyping\u2010by\u2010sequencing data for 178 weedy rice samples collected from across the rice growing region of the southern US; these were analysed together with previously published rice and weedy rice genome sequences to determine the recent genomic and population genetic consequences of adaptive introgression and selection for herbicide resistance in US weedy rice populations. We find a reshaped geographical structure of southern US weedy rice as well as purging of crop\u2010derived alleles in some weed strains of crop\u2010weed hybrid origin. Furthermore, we uncover evidence that related weedy rice strains have made use of different genetic mechanisms to respond to selection. Lastly, we identify widespread presence of HR alleles in both hybrid\u2010derived and nonadmixed samples, which further supports an overall picture of weedy rice evolution and adaptation through diverse genetic mechanisms."

    "content": "Abstract\nHow do individuals tolerate both hot and cold climates of our planet? One possibility is that organisms have plastic traits, such as thermal tolerance, that allow them to function in highly variable environments. In this study, we tested whether phenotypic plasticity of temperature tolerance (i.e., acclimatization in the field and acclimation in the lab) occurs in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, at two temporal scales. We first measured the upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) of ants monthly for 2\u2009years while concurrently measuring environmental conditions. Both CTmax and CTmin covaried with temperature in a predictable way; values increased in a positive, linear manner. We then experimentally tested whether CTmax and CTmin could shift within a shorter time period by exposing subcolonies of ants to cool (10\u00b0C), moderate (20\u00b0C), and hot (30\u00b0C) temperatures for 10\u2009days. CTmax increased only slightly at the hottest temperature treatment (+1.2\u00b0C); however, CTmin increased considerably under both moderate (+2.6\u00b0C) and hot treatments (+3.8\u00b0C). Combined, our results suggest that the thermal tolerance of ants may be more plastic than originally hypothesized, potentially aiding an already thermophilic clade in future climate scenarios."

    "content": "Abstract\nThe Swiss Common Breeding Bird Monitoring (\u201cMonitoring H\u00e4ufige Brutv\u00f6gel\u201d MHB) is a long\u2010term study organized by the Swiss Ornithological Institute. Its main goal is to collect data for estimating breeding population trends of relatively abundant and widespread species. Since 1999, 267 one\u2010km squares laid out in a mostly systematic grid across all of Switzerland have been surveyed annually by skilled, mostly volunteer ornithologists. The sampling sites thus cover a wide range of typical Western European habitats, and an altitudinal range from 250 up to 2750\u2009m above sea level. Bird populations are recorded using a simplified territory mapping protocol with two visits per square above the timberline and three elsewhere. Surveys are conducted during the breeding season (mid\u2010April to early July) along a square\u2010specific transect route that does not change over the years. A typical transect route is between 4 and 6\u2009km long, and each visit usually lasts 3 to 4\u2009h. The location of all visually or acoustically detected birds is recorded on topographical maps or using a smartphone app. Records that meet predefined criteria in terms of species\u2010specific breeding period and observed behavior are retained for the subsequent step of territory delimitation. This is done automatically for most species by the program Autoterri since 2022 and was done manually before, with subsequent checks by an expert. This process finally results in an estimate of the total number of detected territories per species, square and year. The design also explicitly generates detection histories, consisting of two to three numbers that represent the number of territories found to be occupied during each respective visit, enabling the analysis with binomial N\u2010mixture and site\u2010occupancy models. The dataset currently covers the breeding seasons from 1999 to 2024 and includes 6852 site\u2010by\u2010year combinations with estimates of detected territory numbers. It covers 162 of the 166 bird species recorded at least once as potential breeders, excluding four species to prevent potential disturbance at nesting sites. Besides informing about population trends, data from the Swiss Common Breeding Bird Monitoring were used to illustrate several methodological developments in N\u2010mixture, occupancy and related models and to answer scientific and applied questions. With its clearly defined survey method, the largely systematic distribution of its survey sites, and the long timespan covered, it is likely that this dataset will continue to make important contributions in biological and biostatistical research. Herewith, we make the annually updated data set available with a CC BY 4.0 license, allowing researchers and conservationists to use and analyze the data for their own research and conservation efforts."

    "content": "Abstract\nAnalysis of time series data is fundamental in ecology for understanding community dynamics, and the mechanisms driving such dynamics. However, ecological time series commonly contain missing values, which can arise due to methodological changes in monitoring programs, poor weather conditions, logistical constraints, or human error. State\u2010space models are a useful suite of techniques for analyzing ecological time series with missing data. Such models can estimate the unobserved true abundances as latent variables, even for putative census occasions that lack observations. Nevertheless, the impact of missing data on parameter accuracy and precision in these state\u2010space models remains poorly investigated, particularly in species\u2010rich systems. We evaluated the performance of a multivariate process\u2010based state\u2010space model for time series of varying lengths and sampling frequencies, using simulated data informed by empirical counts of reef fish communities from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. We found that despite containing missing data, the models fitted to longer time series produced more accurate and precise parameter estimates compared to shorter, complete\u2010case time series. Additionally, higher spatial replication with uneven census intervals enhanced parameter precision more than maintaining census frequency at the expense of reducing the number of sites. Analysis of reef fish community data revealed attenuation in intrinsic population growth parameters and weaker intraspecific density dependence when modeling longer time series whose inter\u2010census intervals change, while estimates of variability in species' population growth parameters due to environmental fluctuations remained consistent regardless of sampling design. Nonetheless, analyses of shorter, complete\u2010case time series still produced reliable parameter estimates. Our findings highlight the robustness of Bayesian state\u2010space models to missing data, demonstrating that flexibility in long\u2010term monitoring programs does not compromise ecological inference from these models."

    "content": "Abstract\nClimate change impacts ecosystems directly through differences in species\u2010specific responses as well as indirectly through changes to the strength of species interactions. To predict how species will be impacted by ongoing environmental change, we need to better understand the relative roles of these direct and indirect effects. Salinity is a strong driver of ecological patterns and processes, and salinity regimes in coastal regions are expected to be altered by climate change through the intensification of the hydrological cycle and via climate\u2010driven shifts in the timing and strength of the spring freshet. We hypothesized that hyposalinity can indirectly affect the intertidal community by excluding a dominant guild of herbivores, limpets in the genus Lottia. To test this hypothesis, we (1) conducted intertidal diversity surveys in regions of high versus seasonally low salinity in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, (2) conducted laboratory salinity tolerance trials for two important grazers (Lottia pelta and Lottia digitalis) and one primary producer (Ulva sp.), and (3) experimentally manipulated the abundance of grazers in these two regions. We show that rocky intertidal shores from two regions of disparate salinity regimes are distinct in their intertidal communities: low salinity sites were composed primarily of Mytilus trossulus, Fucus distichus, and Ulva sp., whereas high salinity sites were dominated by Chthamalus dalli, Lottia spp., and Mastocarpus sp. Our laboratory trials confirmed that freshwater inputs experienced in the low salinity region resulted in hyposaline levels which exceeded the tolerance of Lottia spp., but not that of Ulva sp. Further, we show that by excluding grazers in high salinity sites, these communities more closely resemble those of the low salinity sites than those of other high salinity sites with grazers present. Together, these results demonstrate that the pattern of distinct estuarine intertidal communities in low versus high salinity regions in the Strait of Georgia may be largely driven by the indirect effects of freshwater inputs, mediated by salinity\u2010driven differences in herbivore population size and thus grazing pressure."

    "content": "Abstract\nMeta\u2010analysis (MA), a powerful tool for synthesizing reported results, is influential in ecology. While ecologists have long been well\u2010informed on the potential problems associated with nonindependence in experimental work (e.g., pseudoreplication), they have, until recently, largely neglected this issue in MA. However, results used in MAs are likely much more similar when they come from the same locality, system, or laboratory. A simple and common form of nonindependence in MA arises when multiple data points, that is, observed effect sizes, come from the same paper. We obtained original data from 20 published MAs, reconstructed the published analyses, and then, for 14 that had not accounted for a paper effect, used three approaches to evaluate whether within\u2010paper nonindependence was a problem. First, we found that \u201cnonsense\u201d explanatory variables added to the original analyses were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) far more often than the expected 5% (25%\u201350% for four nonsense variables). For example, the number of vowels in the first author's name had a significant effect 50% of the time. Second, we found that an added dummy variable, which was randomly assigned at one of two levels, was statistically significant an average of 38% of the time, far exceeding the expected 5%. Even after including a random paper effect in the analyses, there was still an excess of significant results, suggesting that the within\u2010paper nonindependence was more complex than modeled with the random paper effect. Third, we repeated the original MAs that did not include random paper effects (n\u2009=\u200914 MAs) but added a random paper effect to each revised analysis. In 12 out of the 14 MAs, an added random effect was statistically significant (indicating group nonindependence that was not accounted for in the original analyses), and often the original inferences were substantially altered. Further, incorporating random paper effects was not a sufficient solution to nonindependence. Thus, problems resulting from nonindependence are often substantial, and accounting for the problem will likely require careful consideration of the details of the potential dependence among observed effect sizes. MAs that do not properly account for this problem may reach unwarranted conclusions."

    "content": "Abstract\nCosts of reproduction are predicted to shift under climate change, but the extent to which weaker or stronger costs influence population responses to interannual climate variation is unknown. We asked how seasonal climate, manipulated rainfall, and costs of reproduction influence vital rates and population growth in a long\u2010lived herbaceous perennial plant, Primula hendersonii, across an ongoing rainfall manipulation experiment in oak savanna of northwestern North America. Simulated drought reduced population growth rates, and vital rates (e.g., probability of flowering, individual growth) responded individualistically to variation in winter, spring, and summer temperatures, although not to variation in seasonal precipitation. However, only warmer spring temperatures were associated with a decline in population growth rates. Although we observed a weak negative effect of past reproduction on growth and future reproduction for large individuals, these costs of reproduction ultimately did not influence population growth. Further, observational and manipulative experiments to detect costs of reproduction suggest subtle differences in cost expression. We show that direct climate drivers had a stronger effect on population growth than indirect changes in costs of reproduction and may be more important for understanding population persistence under climate change."

    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the stable coexistence of species despite resource competition has been a central topic in ecology. Ant communities are particularly enigmatic as various species coexist despite resource overlap. Community ecology theory predicts stable species coexistence when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition, but due to their perennial and underground life, competition coefficients of ants have never been rigorously measured in the field. We tackled this problem by studying Diacamma cf. indicum, which allows for noninvasive mark\u2013recapture of whole colonies. Several ant species coexisted at the study site where Diacamma was most abundant, and baiting experiments and stable isotope analyses suggested overlapping food niches. Consistently, per worker brood production of Diacamma colonies was significantly negatively correlated with con\u2010 and heterospecific worker densities within the foraging area, suggesting exploitative competition among the ants. In terms of net population growth, however, the estimated intraspecific competition coefficient was about five times larger than the interspecific competition coefficient. This is possibly because exploitative competition for food occurs both intra\u2010 and interspecifically, whereas interference competition occurs mostly among conspecifics. Indeed, for Diacamma worker survival, there was a significant (nonlinear) negative correlation only with the density of conspecific colonies within the foraging area. This is consistent with the observation that Diacamma rarely fought with other species, although it violently attacked conspecific aliens encountered in their nest vicinity. We interpreted these results in light of the recent theory of intraspecific adaptation load. This theory predicts that density\u2010dependent adaptation to intraspecific conflict can intensify intraspecific competition and act to suppress per capita population growth in dominant species, thereby leading to species coexistence with overlapping resources. Our inclusive fitness model suggests that the intraspecific territorial aggression in Diacamma may be a counter\u2010adaptation to intraspecific conflict, that is, brood abduction between conspecific colonies. This aggression pattern can cause the observed density\u2010dependent worker mortality. Our population dynamic model indicates that such density\u2010dependent excess mortality acting on dominant competitors can promote stable coexistence with subordinate competitors. Overall, our results support the intraspecific adaptation load theory that aims at integrating behavioral and community ecology to understand how adaptation interacts with population and community dynamics."

Here, we develop a general theoretical framework integrating life\u2010stage structure into community matrix models and show that stage\u2010specific interactions\u2014especially asymmetric predator\u2010prey dynamics\u2014can fundamentally alter stability outcomes. Our findings reveal that such cross\u2010stage interactions can stabilize communities previously deemed unstable, offering new resolution to the classic complexity\u2013stability paradox.\n\nABSTRACT\nThe relationship between ecosystem complexity and stability remains unresolved and a mechanistic explanation for the stunning levels of biodiversity observed in communities and ecosystems is still lacking. The theoretical study of the stability of ecological communities has long been dominated by the assumption that populations are homogeneous. However, populations are structured, consisting of individuals that differ in multiple traits\u2014such as size or developmental stage\u2014with specific energetic demands and use of space and resources. Stage\u2010specific interactions, such as asymmetric competition for resources or predation targeting particular life stages, are widespread in nature and strongly shape ecological dynamics. Recent theoretical work further demonstrates that differences in juvenile versus adult foraging capacity and predation risk can promote the persistence of larger and more complex communities than those predicted by unstructured models. Here, we develop a general framework to integrate population structure into community stability analyses and show that stage\u2010dependent interactions are key to stability. Specifically, while cross\u2010stage predator\u2013prey interactions enhance stability, competition across different stages destabilises the community. Our results offer new insights into the stability\u2010diversity paradox by showing that stage\u2010structured interactions can effectively increase the magnitude of negative feedbacks and compress the unstable region. Overall, we emphasise the critical role of population structure, an often neglected feature of natural systems, in the stability of ecological communities."

    "content": "<p>by Rakshith Lokesh, Dagmar Sternad</p>\n\nManipulating complex objects is ubiquitous in our daily activities, such as donning a jacket or carrying a cup of coffee. However, such non-rigid objects easily become unstable: When carrying a cup of coffee, the coffee could slosh unpredictably and spill out of the cup. It remains unclear what motor control strategies ensure stability, especially when the physical properties of the object, like the amount of liquid in the cup, are unknown. The task of transporting a \u2018cup of coffee\u2019 was simplified to transporting a virtual cup with a sliding ball inside, modeled as a cart-pendulum system. Participants were instructed to \u2018jiggle\u2019 the cup in one dimension to prepare the cup and ball states for the ensuing continuous rhythmic movement. To introduce uncertainty regarding the object\u2019s properties, the pendulum\u2019s length was manipulated either to 1) change randomly from trial to trial, or to 2) remain constant across trials. We measured the ball\u2019s angle at the end of preparation and the cup\u2019s oscillation frequency during the rhythmic portion of the trial. Grip force on the robot handle served as proxy for mechanical impedance of the arm. The results supported three predictions: 1) When dynamic uncertainty was high, object preparation was important to stabilize the transient dynamics; stability increased during preparation and humans prepared longer when the dynamics was uncertain. 2) Humans maximized dynamic stability by flexibly covarying system initialization and cup frequency; dynamic stability matched participant behavior better than magnitude or smoothness of force. 3) Humans increased their arm impedance to accommodate uncertain dynamics, while the net force applied on the cup remained the same. Feedforward simulations using an impedance controller and stochastic open-loop optimal control corroborated these findings, further revealing that participants\u2019 selection of preparation and interaction frequencies also minimized mechanical impedance. In sum, humans used preparation and interaction strategies to optimize the mechanical impedance and dynamic stability of the hand-object interactions. These results may inform approaches in robotic control and rehabilitation."

In this work, we investigate a computational implementation of the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm using genetic search in a generative model, applied to a visual problem-solving task inspired by star constellations. The search is guided by low-level cues based on the structural fitness of candidate solutions compared to the test images. This dataset serves as a testbed for exploring how inferred signals can guide the synthesis of suitable solutions in ambiguous conditions, framing visual inference as an instance of complex problem solving. Drawing on insights from human experiments, we develop a generative search algorithm and compare its performance to humans, examining factors such as accuracy, reaction time, and overlap in drawings. Our results shed light on possible mechanisms of human visual problem solving and highlight the potential of generative search models to emulate aspects of this process."

Engel, Virginie Hamel, Paul Guichard</p>\n\nCentrioles are polarized microtubule-based structures with appendages at their distal end that are essential for cilia formation and function. The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and iterative U-ExM on human cells, together with in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on mouse tissues, we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centriole\u2019s distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a\u2009~100\u2009nm luminal ring structure consisting of ~27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate \u201cin-to-out\u201d molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation."

    "content": "<p>by Heungjin Ryu, Chie Hashimoto, David A. Hill, Keiko Mouri, Keiko Shimizu, Takeshi Furuichi</p>\n\nIn most mammals, female sexual receptivity (estrus) closely coincides with ovulation, providing males with precise fertility signals. However, in some anthropoid primates living in multi-male societies, females display extended receptivity along with exaggerated sexual swellings that probabilistically indicate ovulation. This raises the question about how males successfully time mating, particularly when ovulation is difficult to predict from such signals. To address this question in bonobos, we combined daily variation in swelling size, hormonal profiles, and male mating behaviors. By estimating day-specific ovulation probabilities relative to the onset and subsidence (detumescence) of maximal swelling, we also examined how male efforts correlate with female fertility. Our results revealed that while ovulation probability was widely distributed and difficult to predict when aligned with the onset of the swelling phase, male behavior was closely aligned with the conception probability. Males concentrated mating efforts late in the phase and stopped after detumescence. High-ranking males intervened in copulations involving females with higher conception probabilities, specifically those with maximal swelling and older infants. When multiple females exhibited maximal swelling, males preferentially followed females whose maximal swelling started earlier and who had older infants. Male\u2013male aggression increased when there were more females with maximal swelling. However, this tendency was reversed when male party size exceeded the average. Importantly, our results revealed that the low predictability of ovulation is best explained by inter- and intra-individual variation in the length of maximal swelling phase, rather than ovulation occurring randomly within that phase in bonobos. Males effectively manage such a noisy signal by prioritizing late-phase ovulatory cues and integrating reproductive history, thereby extracting usable timing information. This behavioral mechanism helps explain the persistence of conspicuous yet noisy ovulatory signals in bonobos. Since males are capable of inferring ovulation timing even under noisy conditions, selection may not favor highly precise female signals. Instead, it shifts more of the time and energy costs onto males, allowing conspicuous female traits to be maintained."

    "link": "https://elifesciences.org/articles/104054",
    "content": "Some of the most important tasks of visual and motor systems involve estimating the motion of objects and tracking them over time. Such systems evolved to meet the behavioral needs of the organism in its natural environment, and may therefore be adapted to the statistics of motion it is likely to encounter. By tracking the movement of individual points in movies of natural scenes, we begin to identify common properties of natural motion across scenes. As expected, objects in natural scenes move in a persistent fashion, with velocity correlations lasting hundreds of milliseconds. More subtly, but crucially, we find that the observed velocity distributions are heavy-tailed and can be modeled as a Gaussian scale-mixture. Extending this model to the time domain leads to a dynamic scale-mixture model, consisting of a Gaussian process multiplied by a positive scalar quantity with its own independent dynamics. Dynamic scaling of velocity arises naturally as a consequence of changes in object distance from the observer, and may approximate the effects of changes in other parameters governing the motion in a given scene. This modeling and estimation framework has implications for the neurobiology of sensory and motor systems, which need to cope with these fluctuations in scale in order to represent motion efficiently and drive fast and accurate tracking behavior."

    "content": "Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of guilt and shame, the cognitive antecedents that trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. We developed a novel task to investigate how two cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling in human participants. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that the integration of harm and responsibility by individuals is consistent with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity representation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (e.g. temporoparietal junction). Guilt-driven and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control. Our findings provide computational, algorithmic, and neural accounts of guilt and shame."

    "content": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly invoked in virtual screening workflows for therapeutics. These mechanistic models project pharmacokinetic outcomes from molecular properties, with data-driven models acting as intermediaries to map molecular structure to PBPK input parameters. Errors in predicted parameters and unvalidated assumptions within PBPK models expose PK predictions to deep uncertainty. Herein, we examine how these uncertainties affect the prediction variability of dynamic, tissue-specific exposure. We validated four PBPK models against 1,854 experimental datapoints - to establish their predictive fidelity before introducing parameter uncertainty typical of property-prediction models. Depending on molecule properties and model choice, the coefficient of variance under parameter uncertainty ranged from 10-5 to 32 for predicted PK statistics. Further, we identified notable model disagreement for a subset of drug-like chemical space characterized by lipophilic, protonated molecules. Uncertainty quantification revealed physicochemical properties and parameter interactions that drove disagreement and highlighted model assumptions that exacerbated prediction variance. Our findings delineate the challenges presented by deep epistemic uncertainty in PBPK modeling."

    "content": "Ticks are ectoparasites that modulate host responses to sustain prolonged blood feeding, and in Ixodes ricinus, salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) represent promising candidates for manipulating host gene expression. Using phylogenetic footprinting combined with cooperative targeting analysis, we identified deeply conserved miRNA-mRNA interactions that appear essential for the tick lifecycle and its ability to parasitize diverse vertebrate hosts. Our findings show that conserved tick miRNAs can mimic host miRNAs by exploiting shared target sites on host transcripts, allowing them to modulate regulatory circuits critical during tick feeding. We identified twelve core salivary miRNAs-highly expressed and enriched in conserved target sites-that cooperatively target twenty-two human genes predominantly expressed in skin and neural tissues. This cooperative suppression converges on host hub genes like PDGFRA and NRG1, linking tick miRNA activity to MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways that regulate immune defense, tissue repair, and sensory responses. Overall, our results demonstrate that I. ricinus miRNAs can synergistically disrupt host homeostasis, and they introduce a broadly applicable framework that leverages evolutionary conservation to detect meaningful cross-species miRNA-mRNA interactions."

    "content": "Motivation: Understanding interactions from microbiome data is a central aspect in microbial ecology, as it provides insights into ecosystem stability, disease mechanisms, and can be used to design synthetic communities. Current network inference tools reconstruct global networks from co-abundance data, which means they capture the overall correlation structure for the entire set of taxa considered. These approaches are computationally intensive and suboptimal when the focus is on the local neighborhood of specific taxa of interest. Results: We introduce NeighborFinder, a local network inference method that enables the targeted discovery of direct neighbors around a species of interest. Using cross-validated multiple linear regression with {ell}1 penalty and microbiome specific filters, our approach infers interpretable species-centered interactions, with F1 score [&ge;] 0.95 on simulated cohorts ranging from 250 to 1000 samples. This method is well-suited for large metagenomic datasets and is particularly valuable for exploratory studies where the targeted hypotheses outweigh the need for global community structure. The approach complements existing methods by being a biologically intuitive and computationally efficient. Availability and Implementation: The R package is freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/ metagenopolis/NeighborFinder.

    "content": "Aging and tissue repair involve multilayered and spatially heterogeneous remodeling across transcriptional, biochemical, and cellular dimensions, yet prevailing definitions rely on isolated molecular markers that obscure how biochemical and transcriptional states co-evolve in tissues. Here we present RamanOmics, a multimodal framework that integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and label-free Raman imaging to map the spatial vibrational-biochemical and molecular architecture of aging and senescence directly in intact tissues. Applied to mouse lung and skin, RamanOmics generates spatially resolved biochemical-molecular maps revealing tissue-specific programs: lung senescent cells are enriched for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and TGF-b; signaling (Serpine1, Dab2, Igfbp7), whereas skin senescence is dominated by keratinization and barrier homeostasis modules (Krt10, Lor, Sbsn). Across tissues, we identify a conserved branched-chain fatty-acid-linked biochemical profile and Raman signature (1131-1135 cm-1) that robustly marks p21+ senescent cells. To unify these layers, we develop a machine learning derived multimodal barcode that quantitatively integrates biochemical and transcriptional features, enabling non-destructive identification of senescence in situ. In a wound-healing model, RamanOmics further reveals coordinated reactivation of barrier-repair programs in senescent cells, marked by upregulation of Krt10, Lor, Sbsn, Sfn, and Dmkn together with matching increases in lipid-associated Raman signatures, confirming biological generalizability beyond steady-state aging. By directly integrating gene programs to spatial vibrational-biochemical states, RamanOmics provides a general framework and resource for scalable, multimodal profiling of cellular states."

    "content": "The Getah virus (GETV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus in the Togaviridae family and the Alphavirus genus, associated with severe disease outbreaks in livestock across the Asia-Pacific regions. Since its first isolation in Malaysia in 1955, GETV has been reported in Eurasia and the South Pacific, yet documented cases in the United States remain exceptionally rare, leaving major gaps in regional vector competence and surveillance data. To evaluate the potential of local mosquito populations as GETV carriers, field collections were conducted in Montgomery and Pike Road neighborhoods of Alabama from 2023 to 2024, capturing multiple mosquito species for molecular screening. Initial real-time qPCR assays on 200 pooled and individual samples suggested that approximately 30% of specimens demonstrated possible GETV carriage potential. To validate viral presence, two distinct primer sets were designed to amplify viral genome fragments. Mosquito RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by nested conventional PCR. The first PCR, targeting ~280 bp, produced single or multiple amplicon bands in 32% of samples via gel electrophoresis. These positive cDNAs were re-amplified with a second primer pair targeting a ~430 bp fragment from a separate genomic region, yielding confirmatory bands in 30% of specimens. Amplified products were purified and Sanger sequenced, revealing approximately 95% nucleotide similarity to the wild-type GETV reference genome. This study delivers the first field-based molecular evidence supporting GETV detection in Alabama mosquitoes, signaling either localized emergence or potential introduction of the virus. These findings underscore the need for expanded vector competence profiling, arboviral surveillance, and livestock disease preparedness in the southeastern United States, strengthening both public health readiness and state-level vector monitoring strategies."

This study investigated the impact of two soy-based foods, soymilk-burkina (SMB), a traditional fermented Ghanaian beverage) and soymilk-millet blend (SMMB), on the gut microbiome of women of reproductive age. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from two cohorts of women consuming either SMB or SMMB soymilk-burkina or a soymilk-millet blend) at 2 weeks pre-intervention, baseline, during an 8-week intervention, and 4 weeks post-intervention. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome. Results: Beta-diversity analysis revealed no significant differences in overall community composition between the two cohorts. Alpha-diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson) showed no significant differences in richness, evenness, or diversity between cohorts, suggesting a balanced gut ecosystem after both interventions. However, 20 dominant bacterial species were identified, including both beneficial (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides vulgatus) and potentially harmful (e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Bacteroides fragilis) taxa. Soymilk-burkina consumption of soymilk-burkina significantly reduced the abundance of Eubacterium rectale (associated with colon cancer) and increased the abundance of F. prausnitzii (beneficial), suggesting potential gut health benefits. However, these effects were transient, highlighting the need for sustained dietary interventions. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the dynamic interplay between diet and the gut microbiome, particularly in the context of traditional fermented foods such as soymilk-burkina. Although short-term changes were observed, the long-term benefits may require consistent consumption. Further research is required to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and their implications on broader health outcomes."

    "content": "Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are a mechanism to control microbial infections conserved across the host species of the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Cysteine S-nitrosylation (SNO) is a reversible post-translational modification that controls complex cell behaviors by regulating protein interactions and signal transduction events. Here we identified a cluster of T. gondii secreted effector proteins that are SNO-modified in a host inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)-dependent manner. Among these were the rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) paralogs, which are the major virulence determinants in T. gondii and an immunodominant antigen in B6 mice. ROP5 was necessary for Type I and Type II parasites to evade IFN-{gamma}-mediated immune clearance in iNOS-deficient macrophages. RNS led to the loss of ROP5 association with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, which is necessary for the known functions of ROP5. Infection with ROP5 knockout parasites rescued the susceptibility of iNOS-deficient mice to infection with Type II T. gondii. Together, these data indicate that RNS can promote cell-autonomous parasite clearance by inhibiting the function of ROP5 paralogs at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane."

Phylogenetic group B2 Escherichia coli (Ec) is frequently isolated from UTI patients, although non-B2 strains have also been isolated. The latter can be associated with Enterococcus faecalis (Ef). UTI involves bacterial growth in the disparate environments of the bladder and intracellularly in uroepithelial cells. The bladder is a low-nutrient environment that nonetheless supports rapid growth. We characterized the interaction between three co-isolated Ec-Ef pairs and other Ec-Ef combinations in a nutrient-rich medium which ws intended to emulate the rapid growth condition of the bladder. In this rich medium, Ef had little effect on Ec growth but resulted in major transcriptome differences. The Ec-Ef interactions were not strain-specific, although Ef affected the non-B2 and B2 strains differently. For the non-B2 Ec strains, Ef induced transcript for genes whose products degrade ornithine via putrescine to succinate which is subsequently metabolized by the TCA cycle. For a control B2 Ec strain, Ef induced transcripts for similar enzymes, except for those that degrade putrescine to succinate, but also for growth rate-associated genes of macromolecular synthesis. Unexpectedly, Ef induced transcripts for glyoxylate shunt enzymes in both non-B2 and B2 Ec strains. The bacterial environments during UTI are disparate and changing, which will require several layers of Ec-Ef interactions. Our results provide evidence for nutrient cross-feeding as one type of Ec-Ef interaction."

    "content": "Diderm bacteria use contact-dependent Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) to gain a competitive advantage within bacterial communities and during infection. Whereas the structural core assembly of T6SS is well characterized, the role of diverse accessory proteins during assembly remains under investigation. One well-conserved accessory protein is TagF, a post-translational inhibitor of T6SS dynamics, which was previously characterized in the context of a kinase-phosphatase signaling relay. Here, we identify a subset of T6SS clusters in which TagF occurs in a distinct regulatory context and without known binding partners. Investigating the role of TagF in the constitutively active Acinetobacter baylyi T6SS, we show that though TagF can suppress assembly dynamics, it primarily acts as an assembly coordinator. Using structured illumination microscopy, we show that TagF coordinates the transition from baseplate assembly to sheath elongation by preventing premature and nonproductive sheath assembly in absence of the VgrG spike. Direct interactions with the conserved T6SS tube protein Hcp suggested that TagF blocks sheath elongation by binding and disrupting Hcp hexamers and thus preventing tube formation. Finally, we show that TagF activity depends on crosstalk with TagZ, a previously uncharacterized membrane associated accessory protein that recruits TagF to the cell periphery, and demonstrate that this interaction can be specifically disrupted by expression of an artificial TagF-binding protein. Together, our [fi]ndings establish a novel role of TagF as a checkpoint protein that controls for spike-insertion into the baseplate to ensure effective T6SS assembly."

    "content": "The inflammation induced by Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the female genital tract (FGT) can have severe consequences. Recent observations in women and mice infected with Chlamydia suggest that type I interferon (IFN-I) may have deleterious effects. This study aimed at elucidating the consequences of IFN-I production on C. trachomatis-induced inflammation in epithelial cells and the molecular pathway(s) involved. We showed that combination of IFN-I and Chlamydia resulted in a stronger induction of inflammation than Chlamydia alone, while IFN-I alone had no effect. Inhibiting AKT and mTOR, but not silencing STAT1, significantly attenuated the synergetic effect between IFN-I and bacteria on inflammation. Inhibition of ERK also blocked this synergistic effect, although ERK were not activated by IFN-I. We hypothesized that IFN-I enhanced the expression of a pathogen recognition receptor of the host, thereby potentiating detection of the bacteria and the subsequent inflammatory response. IFN-I, but not C. trachomatis infection, increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and silencing or knocking-out TLR3 prevented the synergetic effect between infection and IFN-I. Furthermore, our data support the presence of dsRNA in infected cells and the activation of the MAPK/ERK and AP-1/ATF2 signaling cascades downstream of TLR3. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IFN-I exacerbates the host inflammatory response triggered by Chlamydia by increasing TLR3 expression and activation, leading to hyperinflammation. The identified signaling cascades represent potential targets for therapeutical intervention to limit tissue damage upon Chlamydia infection."

    "content": "DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes found in all cells, where they regulate DNA supercoiling. Reverse gyrase (RG) is a unique type of topoisomerase that introduces positive supercoils into DNA and appears exclusively in hyperthermophiles where it was proposed to play a key, yet still elusive, role. Here, we investigate RG activity in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis at 85C, its optimal growth temperature, using genetics and functional genomics assays. Deletion of RG led to a loss of positive supercoiling in plasmid DNA and the reduced dynamic range of transcription, without affecting histone occupancy. To investigate the effects of RG loss on the topology of chromosomal DNA, we established a psoralen photobinding assay (TMP-seq) in T. kodakarensis under native growth conditions. TMP enrichment patterns were consistent with the twin-domain model of transcription and further revealed that promoters of expressed transcription units are, on average, underwound. TMP-seq profiles in an RG deletion strain revealed that promoters are hotspots for RG activity, consistent with RG acting on hyper-negatively supercoiled substrates. We propose that RG acts not as a global modulator of supercoiling, but as a local genome guardian, selectively stabilising vulnerable regulatory regions to ensure a delicate balance between DNA accessibility and integrity under extremely high temperatures."

    "content": "Bacteria adapt by undergoing dynamic structural changes in response to environmental cues, which are often indicative of deeper phenotypic shifts in physiology and behavior. Understanding these changes across length scales is crucial for elucidating bacterial lifecycles, informing antifouling surface design, enhancing pathogen detection, and advancing renewable energy applications. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) enables high-resolution imaging of bacterial structures in hydrated, biologically relevant conditions. However, current quantitative analysis strategies that extract structural information from bacterial samples remain labor-intensive. This work presents an AI-driven segmentation workflow tailored to low-dose cryoEM datasets to rapidly analyze bacterial ultrastructural features from Pantoea sp. YR343, a Gram-negative bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Populus deltoides that forms robust biofilms along plant roots. YOLOv11 image segmentation quantifies inner and outer membrane thickness and flagella length, enabling automated analysis of bacterial ultrastructure. The workflow reliably distinguishes membranes from carbon edges of the TEM grid and contaminant crystalline ice while matching manual measurements and increasing throughput. Flagella detection routines additionally quantify nearest-neighbor proximity between bacterial envelopes and flagella. A field-of-view module further detects bacteria at low magnification for rapid screening. Together, these tools provide a scalable and automated framework for high-throughput, quantitative analysis of bacterial ultrastructure in cryoEM data."

    "content": "Tuberculous meningitis (TB meningitis), the deadliest form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, leads to mortality and severe neurological disability despite standard therapy. Brain injury and microglial activation are major determinants of outcome, yet the mechanisms linking infection, inflammation and neuronal injury remain poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), key mediators of cell-to-cell communication, have been investigated in pulmonary TB but their role in TB meningitis remains unexplored. We used our young rabbit model of TB meningitis to isolate pure, intact EVs from brain tissue (i.e., brain-derived EVs) from infected and uninfected rabbits and used nanoflow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and protein quantification to characterize the EVs. Comparative proteomic profiling was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by in silico pathway, cell-type and protein-protein interaction analyses using DAVID, Enrichr, and STRING databases. We found that EV isolation from fresh and frozen tissue was equivalent and demonstrated that M. tuberculosis infection activated EV biogenesis. Despite preserved vesicle morphology, EVs from infected brain showed a significant proteomic shift characterized by enrichment of TB host defense, microglial and immune activation, metabolic excitotoxicity, and neuronal injury. These proteome dysregulations suggest that infection reprograms brain EV cargo toward proinflammatory and metabolic stress responses while depleting neuronal and mitochondrial components. Collectively, these data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis infection alters the cargo and abundance of brain-derived EV, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and mediators of host-pathogen interactions in TB meningitis."

    "content": "Bacteria control individualistic and group behaviors using a form of cell-cell communication called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing relies on the production of chemical signals called autoinducers and the subsequent detection of those signals by a cognate receptor. Many Gram-negative bacteria use the LuxR-type family of transcription factor receptors that bind to acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducer signals to regulate their function as DNA-binding proteins. A subclass of this family of transcription factor receptors requires their cognate autoinducer to fold and dimerize to bind DNA to regulate gene expression and, thus, traits associated with quorum sensing, such as biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we use a chemical-genetic approach to determine the structural basis for ligand selection by the quorum-sensing receptor RhlR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The native ligand for RhlR is N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, and this protein-ligand interaction is important for initiating gene expression in P. aeruginosa. We determine key residues that drive ligand specificity and selectivity of RhlR to define the role of ligand-driven RhlR-dependent gene regulation of quorum-sensing traits, namely the differential expression of the phenazine genes, which encode the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the redox-sensitive virulence factor pyocyanin, among other phenazines. Furthermore, we provide a chemical-genetic framework for future studies aimed at disrupting the RhlR-ligand interaction to suppress virulence in P. aeruginosa, an important nosocomial pathogen with widespread antimicrobial resistance."

    "content": "Ciprofloxacin resistance is widespread in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, despite its discontinuation as recommended treatment option in 2007. Unintentional low-level exposure to ciprofloxacin, e.g., environmental or food-borne, might provide sufficiently high selection pressure to maintain resistance and compensate potential fitness costs. We used a mathematical within-host model of gonorrhoea to investigate the effect of low-level ciprofloxacin exposure on susceptibility. We present a mechanistic within-host model of gonococcal infections in the male urethra, to simulate the influence of low-level ciprofloxacin exposures on gonococcal ciprofloxacin susceptibility. We assessed the impact of repeated exposures to varying amounts of ciprofloxacin (0-0.75mg/day) in a chain of sequentially transmitted infections. Daily exposure to at least 0.15mg ciprofloxacin was sufficient to select for low-level resistance. Moreover, in the absence of ciprofloxacin treatment, resistant variants could revert back to variants with lower levels of resistance. However, background exposure can balance fitness costs of resistance and prevent a complete reversion to the fully susceptible variant. Even for human-host restricted pathogens such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a One Health approach that considers unintentional antibiotic exposures is needed to avoid the emergence and spread of resistance."

    "content": "Adding to the global burden of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, an unprecedented five HPAI H7 outbreaks occurred globally in 2024. Of these, three occurred in southeast Australia, with the independent emergence of HPAI H7N9, H7N8, and H7N3, resulting in the destruction of 2 million poultry. Historical data demonstrates that H7 outbreaks in Australia do not occur randomly, rather, there is a strong association between the timing of the previous H7 outbreaks and rainfall patterns in southeastern Australia. We aimed to address a hypothesis wherein prior to H7 outbreaks in poultry, there was a detectable change in H7 prevalence and/or virus diversity in wild bird populations. We addressed this using virological and serological surveillance data generated from multiple programs. Despite the collection of thousands of samples, there was only weak evidence to support our hypothesis, which provides strong incentive to evaluate current surveillance approaches for the purposes of risk prediction. However, in alignment with a previous analysis, there is strong support for a relationship between H7 outbreak probability and rainfall patterns across southeast Australia. Overall, improved understanding of the ecology and evolution of H5 and H7 viruses in wild bird reservoirs is pivotal to global disease preparedness and response."

    "content": "Bacterial exposure to constant phage attack drives rapid diversification of anti-phage defense systems, often through the exchange of modular defensive domains. Here, we leverage this modularity signature to identify new defense systems by systematically searching for operons encoding defensive domains in non-canonical configurations. We identified 214,164 candidate defense operons in E. coli genomes, representing a ~2.2-fold expansion over defense systems detected by DefenseFinder. Experimental testing of 9 candidates validated 6 with anti-phage activity. These include DarTG and ietAS system variants that have acquired helicase modules, and a Gabija system in which a MazF-like protein replaces GajA, implying novel anti-phage mechanisms. We also identified a new clade of Pycsar and show that it synergizes with type IV Thoeris to broaden phage protection. Our findings demonstrate that mining modular defensive domains provides a powerful strategy to predict and characterize new anti-phage systems, expanding the known repertoire of bacterial immunity."

    "content": "Emerging studies suggest that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome and alter vaccine-induced immune responses, but the specific consequences of early-life exposure on neonatal immune development remains poorly understood. Here, we examined how two antibiotics frequently used in perinatal care, broad-spectrum ampicillin (AMP) and the extended-spectrum combination amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMOX/CLAV), administered during gestation and lactation, influence neonatal gut microbiome composition, fecal metabolome profiles, and responses to the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20). Maternal treatment with AMOX/CLAV, but not AMP, significantly reduced PCV-specific IgG titers at 4- and 6-weeks post-prime immunization compared to untreated controls. Exclusive exposure to AMOX/CLAV also impaired neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytic killing, indicating diminished antibody functionality. These effects were transient, with immune parameters normalizing by week 8 post-prime immunization. Metabolomic and microbiome profiling revealed that maternal AMP and AMOX/CLAV differentially perturbed specific metabolite classes including bile acids, N-acyl lipids, and indole-derivatives, as well as key commensal taxa including Bacteroidales and Coriobacteriales within the gut microbiota. Together, these findings reveal a previously underappreciated maternal-offspring route of antibiotic influence that transiently disrupts neonatal vaccine responsiveness through microbiome and metabolome alterations. These results highlight maternal antibiotic exposure as a modifiable factor shaping early-life immunity."

    "content": "Fascioliasis, a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, poses a significant threat to livestock and human health globally. Climate change is altering the transmission dynamics of this disease; however, the direction and magnitude of this change remain uncertain due to a lack of mechanistically grounded predictions at continental scale. In this study, we developed a novel risk index to assess how climate change may affect the potential for fascioliasis transmission across Africa and Europe. The index integrates the following three components that together capture the environmental requirements for Fasciola transmission: the temperature dependence of the parasite transmission; climatic suitability for the snail intermediate host; and availability of freshwater habitats. To estimate these components, we used data from published experimental studies, thousands of snail occurrence records, and both mechanistic and correlative modelling approaches. We predict that climate change will generally reduce fascioliasis risk across most of the ranges of the two investigated liver fluke species, albeit with marked geographical differences. The transmission risk of F. gigantica is predicted to decrease in the Sahel and West Africa, due to above-optimal temperatures for parasite transmission and climatic suitability for the intermediate hosts. However, risk for F. hepatica transmission is projected to increase in parts of Northern Europe, Scandinavia, and Iceland, where livestock densities are high. We also find that the potential for hybridization between F. hepatica and F. gigantica may decline due to reduced geographic overlap in areas that are highly suitable for transmission. By providing a scalable, ecologically informed framework for predicting fascioliasis risk under climate change, this study lays the groundwork for improved local risk assessment. Our results provide a more nuanced perspective on the potential impact of climate change on fascioliasis transmission, showing that this will be highly uneven across Africa and Europe."

This number has likely increased substantially with the development of new analytical methods and the widespread adoption of computers and softwares. In this study, I investigated the temporal variation in statistical procedures and the use of softwares used in studies on plant ant interactions. Data were collected from 142 published papers covering a period between 1979 to 2023. Information related to statistics terminology, the softwares cited and R software packages were retrieved. Each paper had on average eight statistical procedures and there was a significant increase in procedures over the years. The R software was cited in almost 80 percent of studies, surpassing by far the other softwares. Classical analyses such as t tests, correlations and chi-squares are still used in research; nonetheless, from 2012 onward a new set of analyses including GLM, GLMM and Networks have emerged and are being used as the leading analyses in studies of plant-ant interactions. This coincides with the adoption of R software by scientists in this field. The most used R packages were vegan, lme4 and bipartite, followed by several other related to linear (mixed) models. Statistics literacy is a mandatory aspect of research in plant ant interactions. The increase in statistical procedures over the years, as well as the emergence of new tests can be considered as a natural evolution of the field with demand for robustness in methods and analyses."
