    "content": "The thermal stability of sodium solid electrolytes, especially their reactivity with electrodes, remains unclear, hindering safety assessment. This work systematically compares six representative sodium SEs. While inorganic solid electrolytes are intrinsically thermally stable, their exothermic reactions with electrodes highlight that overall battery safety depends on electrode\u2010electrolyte thermal compatibility, not just electrolyte stability alone, providing new insights for ASSB safety design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs) are widely regarded as promising nextgeneration energy storage systems due to their high energy density and enhanced safety. Na\u2010based ASSBs, in particular, offer compelling advantages through the use of earth\u2010abundant and low\u2010cost materials. However, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding the thermal stability of sodium solid electrolytes (SEs)\u2014especially their reactivity with electrode materials\u2014hindering reliable safety assessment. Herein, we present a systematic comparison of the thermal behavior of six representative sodium SEs: Na3Zr2Si2PO12, Na3PS4, NaAlCl4, Na2ZrCl6, NaAlCl2.5O0.75, and PEO. While inorganic SEs demonstrate good intrinsic thermal stability, most exhibit significant exothermic reactions with cathode or anode materials upon heating, releasing considerable heat that could trigger thermal runaway. Notably, chloride\u2010based SEs show markedly different reactivities\u2014NaAlCl4 reacts violently with Na15Sn4, whereas Na2ZrCl6 remains remarkably stable, highlighting the crucial role of reaction kinetics and melting point in modulating thermal stability. The findings reveal that electrode\u2013electrolyte compatibility under thermal stress\u2014not just the stability of the SE alone\u2014is a decisive factor for ASSB safety. Our work underscores the critical role of electrode\u2010electrolyte thermal stability, offering new insights into the safety design of all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries.",

    "content": "In anode has been widely used in labs due to its stability. However, it still suffers failure at high current density and areal capacity. This work demonstrates the failure mechanism of In anode and propose protective layer by atomic layer deposition could effectively enhance the performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAlloy\u2010based anodes, particularly indium (In) are emerging as promising candidates for achieving long\u2010cycle life in all\u2010solid\u2010state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), due to their dendrite\u2010free characteristics and ability to stabilize the anode interface. However, their practical applications remain hindered by limitations in the failure of In anodes under high current densities and areal capacities, where the incomplete understanding of the underlying failure mechanism limits the optimization strategies. Herein, we employ advanced characterization techniques to systematically investigate the failure mechanisms of In anodes under high current densities and areal capacities. Our findings reveal that alloying and dealloying processes involve an electro\u2010chemo\u2010mechanical coupling failure mechanism and further exacerbate performance degradation. By elucidating these failure mechanisms, our work provides critical insights and rational surface protection strategies by ALD coating with Al2O3 layer for enhancing the interfacial stability and performance of alloy anodes in ASSLBs. The maximum cycling capacity of the Li/In asymmetric cell at 0.5\u00a0mA/cm2 was enhanced from 0.2 to 2 mAh/cm2 (>200 cycles). This work paves the way for the development of durable, high\u2010energy\u2010density batteries.",

    "content": "A molecular\u2010structure\u2010dependent redox\u2010mediated CO2 reduction reaction mechanism is proposed in aprotic Li\u2010CO2 batteries through a comparative investigation of model quinone (Q)\u2010based catalysts. It is revealed that the introduction of electron\u2010withdrawing groups (EWGs) into Q\u2010moiety enhances discharge potentials and Q\u2010CO2 adduct dissociation to form Li2CO3 and CO, while reducing CO2 binding affinity. Moderate EWG substitution balances CO2 affinity and adducts dissociation to improve discharge capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nRedox mediators (RMs) emerge as critical enablers for unlocking the energy potentials of aprotic Li\u2010CO2 batteries through solution\u2010mediated CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the structural effect of RMs on CO2RR pathways and catalytic efficiency remains insufficiently understood. Herein, through a comparative investigation of model quinone (Q)\u2010based RMs using in situ spectroscopic techniques coupled with theoretical calculations, it is revealed that reduced Q species chemically bind with CO2 to form metastable Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts (n, x = 1 or 2), which subsequently dissociate into LiCO2 intermediates and further generate Li2CO3 and CO as discharge product while regenerating LinQ (n = 0 or 1) for sustained redox cycling. The dissociation of Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts constitutes the rate\u2010determining step under non\u2010polarization conditions. The introduction of electron\u2010withdrawing groups (EWGs) into the Q moiety can enhance discharge potentials, but creates a kinetic trade\u2010off: increased dissociation kinetics of Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts and suppressed adduct formation due to diminished CO2 binding affinity for reduced Q species. Strategic electronic modulation via optimized EWG substitution balances this CO2 affinity and adducts dissociation equilibrium, achieving simultaneous improvements in discharge potential and capacity. Our work provides fundamental guidelines for the rational design of advanced RMs in next\u2010generation Li\u2010CO2 batteries.",

    "content": "The strong oxophilicity of VM1 sites promotes H2O adsorption by interacting with its O atoms. Concurrently, photoholes accumulating at adjacent O\u2212 sites could be rapidly injected into these VM1 sites, facilitating H2O dissociation to produce protons. Moreover, the VM1 sites modulate the local coordination environment of neighboring M2 sites, which enhances the capture of photoelectrons, thereby boosting CO2 adsorption and activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPhotocatalytic CO2 methanation is fundamentally constrained by two intertwined bottlenecks: inefficient proton generation from H2O dissociation and the premature desorption of the critical *CO intermediate. Here, we design metal cation vacancy clusters\u2010O\u2212 motifs for accelerating H2O dissociation and boosting *CO protonation, while supported metal sites for CO2 activation over metal\u2010anchored metal oxide nanosheets. As a prototype, we fabricate Au/TiO2\u2010VTi nanosheets, where synchrotron\u2010radiation X\u2010ray absorption fine structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirm VTi\u2010O\u2212 and coordination\u2010unsaturated Au sites. Density\u2010functional\u2010theory calculations reveal the creation of VTi\u2010O\u2212 sites drive the step of *CO protonation toward *CHO from an endothermic process (0.09\u00a0eV) to an exothermic one (\u22120.29\u00a0eV), and concurrently the energy for H2O dissociation into protons is lowered by a factor of two (1.31\u00a0eV \u2192 0.65\u00a0eV). In situ Fourier\u2010transform infrared spectroscopy directly captures a distinct *CO intermediate, confirming its stabilization on the photocatalyst surface and thereby promoting the protonation step toward *CHO. Consequently, the Au/TiO2\u2010VTi nanosheets show a superior CH4 formation rate of 156.5\u00a0\u00b5mol g\u22121 h\u22121 with near\u2010100% selectivity. Briefly, this work offers key insights into CO2 methanation bottlenecks and proposes a catalyst design blueprint to advance CO2 valorization.",

    "content": "An electronic regulation strategy was proposed to construct an electronic inversion layer (EIL) on interface between MOFs and Mxene, for enhancing the conductivity of MOFs, to optimize the lithium\u2010ion storage and cycling stability. The obtained MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx did well reduce polarization and facilitated the formation of the SEI. As a result, the composite achieved a capacity retention of 94% (450.3 mAh/g) after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMetal\u2010organic frameworks (MOFs) are rising stars for Li\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) electrodes. However, low conductivity of MOFs easily caused polarization and poor active site utilization. Here, an innovative electronic inversion layer (EIL) was proposed to guide the composite and interface design of MIL\u201053(Fe) with Ti3C2Tx, prompting a remarkable increase in the electrical conductivity of MIL\u201053(Fe) from 4.94 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5S/cm to 46.65 mS/cm (30\u00a0MPa). This enhancement is attributed to the EIL activated by Ti3C2Tx effectively shift the primary charge carriers from holes to high\u2010mobility electrons. Simultaneously, the localized EIL promoted the formation of a p\u2013n junction and establishes a hole concentration gradient in MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx, thereby accelerating lithium\u2010ion diffusion kinetics. Consequently, the MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx delivered a superior capacity of 450.3 mAh/g at 1 A/g, and the possible retention of 94% capacity after 1000 cycles, exceeding those of the MIL\u201053(Fe) and Ti3C2Tx. This investigation into MXene\u2010activated EIL presents an innovative strategy and mechanism of universal significance for addressing the inherent conductivity challenges acted by a series of electrode materials, especially MOFs and COFs.",

    "content": "While perovskite solar cells have been widely studied, including their stability, perovskite indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) have only recently emerged. Nevertheless, more studies are appearing in the literature. The systematic stability study of IPVs is crucial, particularly given the inconsistencies in reported methodologies and results, which call for standardized protocols to build confidence in the field and advance the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMetal halide perovskite indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are the top contenders in terms of efficiency among emerging IPV technologies. The state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art perovskite IPVs have already achieved reported efficiencies above 44%, indicating their significant potential. However, only a small percentage of reports discuss stability measurements, with approximately 7% adopting the International Summit on Organic PV Stability (ISOS) protocol for stability evaluation. A standard for the stability assessment of emerging thin film IPVs still lags. This research area remains largely unexplored, yet it is essential to the commercialization of IPV technologies. This review focuses on perovskite\u2010based IPVs, with an emphasis on device stability. It provides discussions of the origins of degradation in perovskite materials and their corresponding IPV devices. This is followed by an overview of various structure\u2013property\u2013stability strategies, including compositional, interface, and device\u00a0design engineering for perovskite materials to improve their performance. Finally, the review outlines some existing stability test protocols that could apply to perovskite IPVs, including addressing mitigation issues, such as encapsulation, draws the attention of researchers in the field, and calls for the development of standardized stability test protocols for perovskite IPVs and for understanding how these tests correlate with actual indoor lifespans to enable the commercialization of perovskite IPVs.",

    "content": "Key interfacial engineering strategies in PEM electrolyzers are illustrated, targeting four interfaces: gas diffusion layer\u2010catalyst, catalyst\u2010electrolyte, catalyst\u2010membrane, and membrane\u2010electrode assembly. These approaches promote CO2 delivery, suppress hydrogen evolution, balance local proton and ion transport, and stabilize microenvironments, enabling selective and durable CO2 electroreduction under acidic conditions at industrially relevant current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers offers a pathway to close the carbon cycle and produce sustainable fuels and chemicals at industrial\u2010scale current densities. Acidic operation enables compact reactor architectures and superior single\u2010pass carbon utilization, yet faces persistent challenges including parasitic hydrogen evolution, catalyst corrosion and deactivation, along with constrained local CO2 transport. This review highlights recent progress in interfacial microenvironmental engineering that reconcile acidic operation with selective and durable CO2 conversion. We organize strategies across four critical interfaces: (1) the gas diffusion layer\u2010catalyst layer interface, where engineered hydrophobicity and pore structure promote CO2 delivery while maintaining a stable three\u2010phase boundary; (2) the catalyst\u2010electrolyte electric double layer interface, where control over interfacial fields, pH gradients, and adsorbate binding energetics suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction while promoting CO2RR selectivity; (3) at the catalyst layer\u2010membrane interface, where optimized ionomer distribution and tailored proton conductivity balance local proton availability, mitigating catalyst degradation; and (4) the integrated membrane\u2010electrode assembly, where harmonized ion transport, CO2 flux, and electron conduction stabilizes the microenvironment for long\u2010term durability. By consolidating mechanistic insights and practical design principles, this review provides a roadmap for rational interfacial engineering to realize efficient, durable, and scalable acidic CO2 electroreduction in PEM electrolyzers.",
