    "content": "Applying a highly concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) trapped within a polymer matrix on the anode significantly enhances the cycling stability of lithium\u2010ion batteries with high\u2010loading electrodes. This spatial confinement of LiTFSI induces preferential decomposition at the anode surface, thereby forming a stable, inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer, while LiPF6 in the bulk electrolyte prevents aluminum current collector corrosion caused by LiTFSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAmong promising lithium salts for electrolyte in lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) forms a more stable inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer. However, its implementation is limited by severe aluminum current collector corrosion. Since lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) contributes a stable passivation layer for aluminum, a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte offers reduced corrosion. However, its corrosion inhibition capability is not complete. Herein, we propose a SEI\u2010stabilizing and corrosion\u2010preventing layer (SCL) that realizes spatial separation of salts, which confines concentrated LiTFSI within a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) network at the anode\u2010LiPF6 electrolyte interface. The locally high concentration of LiTFSI in SCL induces a kinetic preference that overrides the thermodynamic preference of LiPF6, which enables targeted decomposition of LiTFSI to form a robust SEI layer, while using only a small amount of LiTFSI. Furthermore, SCL demonstrates excellent corrosion\u2010inhibiting behavior compared to a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte. Consequently, SCL enables stable cycling of high\u2010loading (21.4\u00a0mg cm\u22122) practical NCM811/graphite full cells with 93.57% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high current density of 2.2\u00a0mA cm\u22122. This strategy enables selective electrochemical reactions through spatial confinement to enhance LIB performance, while suppressing side reactions and reducing costs, providing a scalable approach for next\u2010generation electrolyte design.",

This remodeling induces the reconstruction of band structure and the expansion of hexagonal region, which accelerates the movement of both electrons and ions within the material and electrode structures. The structural enhancement facilitates the fast\u2010charging and cycle stability of a pure silicon anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSustainable electrification continues to drive growing interest in high\u2010performance lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), which are essential energy storage systems for this transition. However, conventional graphite\u2010based LIBs cannot meet the stringent requirements of next\u2010generation applications, necessitating advanced alternatives. Herein, we report the design of fluorine\u2010incorporated silicon (FIS) nanostructures through a novel solid\u2013vapor\u2013solid synthesis method that integrates metallothermic reduction with combined top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up processes.

Interstitial F modifies the direct\u2010allowed band structure of Si and expands lithium penetration pathways, thereby enhancing charge transport through improved electronic conductivity and ion migration. Meanwhile, surface\u2010bound F induces superhydrophobicity, enabling hydrofluoric acid\u2010free processing during both synthesis and electrode fabrication.

    "content": "To further enhance the environmental sustainability and cost advantages of sodium\u2010ion batteries, it is essential to develop low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free layered oxide cathode materials. From the perspectives of cost and electrochemical performance, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in sodium\u2010ion batteries, with the resulting key scientific challenges and effective solution strategies summarized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) are the most widely used commercial rechargeable batteries, but the stable supply of key raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt faces challenges. Sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as potential alternatives and complements to LIBs due to similar working principles and the abundance of sodium resources. Layered oxide cathode materials (LOCMs) are recognized as one of the most promising practical cathodes for SIBs because of mature synthesis technology and satisfactory energy density. However, the use of nickel in LOCMs for SIBs has raised concerns about environmental pollution during nickel production and the risk of price volatility stemming from the widespread application of high\u2010nickel LOCMs for LIBs. Therefore, developing low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free LOCMs is crucial for enhancing the environmental friendliness and cost advantages of SIBs. For low\u2010cost LOCMs, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in SIBs, and summarizes the resulting critical scientific challenges (Fe migration, Mn dissolution, Jahn\u2010Teller effect, Na deficiency, and thermal instability). Economic efficiency assessment based on cost and electrochemical properties indicates that low\u2010cost LOCMs exhibit the highest cost\u2010performance ratio. Finally, to accelerate the commercialization of cost\u2010effective SIBs technologies, this review outlines promising development pathways of low\u2010cost LOCMs.",

    "content": "This study reports an integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membrane fabricated via a bottom\u2010up relay phase inversion strategy, overcoming the long\u2010standing trade\u2010off in traditional porous membranes. Bilateral skin layers protect the macropore support layer, suppressing fouling and enhancing mechanical robustness. Tunable sub\u2010nanometer pores and an integrated symmetric architecture align well with flow batteries, enabling efficient and durable operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nA bottom\u2010up relay strategy is first proposed to fabricate integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membranes (macropore layer between bilateral skin layers) by ingeniously introducing a non\u2010solvent carrier. Benefiting from the phase inversion relay process, bilateral skin layers can be tailored freely, where ethylene glycol in the non\u2010solvent carrier effectively regulates the structure of the bottom skin layer by adjusting the ratio of free water to bound water. Thus, a dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane is designed and applied in a vanadium flow battery (VFB), that features symmetric skin layers (\u223c600\u00a0nm) with sub\u2010nanometer (\u223c4.5\u00a0\u00c5) pores. The symmetric structure reduces the pressure required for proton migration via the Vehicle mechanism, and the sub\u2010nanometer pores effectively separate vanadium ions from protons by size exclusion, breaking the trade\u2010off in traditional membranes. Moreover, the bilateral skin layers protect the macropore layer against the vanadium fouling and mechanical damage. Furthermore, the formation mechanism and ion transport dynamics of the dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane are analyzed by molecular dynamics and multi\u2010physical field simulation. As a result, the optimized membrane enables stable VFB operation for over 6000 cycles at 200\u00a0mA cm\u22122 with energy efficiency of \u223c83.6%. This work provides an effective approach to prepare integrated symmetric membranes with bilateral skin layers.",

The fundamental mechanisms governing its high performance have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that centrosymmetry breaking in [001] preferentially oriented \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 thin films (POF) arises from inevitable anisotropic strain during film formation. Using circular polarization\u2010dependent pump\u2010probe transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe Rashba\u2010type band splitting exclusively in POF, indicating symmetry breaking. Angle\u2010dependent X\u2010ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) reveal significant residual stress in POF compared to randomly oriented films (ROF), confirming strain\u2010induced lattice distortion. Furthermore, time\u2010resolved PL and microwave conductivity measurements reveal top\u2010back inhomogeneous carrier dynamics and anisotropic charge carrier mobility, supporting the presence of the anisotropic strain\u2010induced symmetry breaking.

However, the commercially used iridium\u2010based anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in PEMWEs still suffer from notably poor reactivity. At present, the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) is an important route to achieve both high activity and durability in OER. Nevertheless, the performance of conventional Ir\u2010based crystalline OER catalysts following the OPM pathway remains far below their theoretical limit, which is significantly hindered by two intrinsic limitations. First, their rigid lattice structures prevent the shortening of metal\u2010metal distances, which is essential to facilitate the rate\u2010determining O*\u2500O* dimerization. Second, the repulsion between O* adsorbates during OER inevitably weakens the metal = O* bond and undermines the overall oxygen evolution efficiency. Herein, we report that an amorphous IrMOx catalyst elegantly overcomes the limitations of the OPM pathway by virtue of its dynamic surface structure and strong oxophilicity of M.\u00a0 The dynamic surface structure promotes O*\u2500O* coupling, while the oxophilic nature of M compensates for the inherent weakening of the metal = O* bond during OER. Because of that, the catalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance, along with excellent catalytic durability over 1200 h\u2019 PEM testing.",

By encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles with an atomically thin carbon layer, the lattice expansion of Co3O4 during Kirkendall oxidation is constrained to a controllable strain range of 0.2\u20131.8%. This approach establishes a strain\u2010activity relationship for the oxygen evolution reaction in oxides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile Kirkendall oxidation (KO) facilely fabricates transition metal oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), it concomitantly triggers detrimental lattice expansion. For Co3O4, an appealing IrO2\u2010alternative catalyst, KO generates a free lattice expansion above 2.4%, resulting in suboptimal activity and stability. Here, we design a confined KO approach and coat the precursor Co nanoparticles with atomic carbon layers, enabling controllable lattice expansion of Co3O4 between 0.2% and 1.8%. For the first time, a strain\u2010dependent OER activity of Co3O4 is established in acidic media, with an expansion strain of 1.4% exhibiting the lowest overpotential of 377\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122.

    "content": "The densification process of Li6PS5Cl powders with varying particles size distributions reveals differences in smaller and larger distributions. Higher strain is revealed for the smaller particle size distribution from X\u2010ray diffraction. Discrete element method simulations uncover that the reason for the higher strain is not the particle size itself, but rather the larger inhomogeneity of particles in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid\u2010state battery fabrication requires the densification of solid electrolytes to achieve optimal cycling performance and high energy density. However, the underlying compaction mechanisms of these electrolytes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of pressure consolidation on the ionic conductor Li6PS5Cl with particle size distributions (PSD) ranging from 4 to 40 \u00b5m. Heckel analysis reveals that samples with smaller PSDs exhibit higher compressibility at lower pressures. X\u2010ray diffraction peak profiling shows that applied pressure induces lattice strain, leading to peak broadening, while pair distribution function analysis demonstrates a reduction in coherence length upon pressing. Dark\u2010field X\u2010ray microscopy further provides spatially resolved orientation maps, uncovering intragranular structural variations within individual Li6PS5Cl agglomerates after compression. To better understand the origin of stress fluctuations, we performed discrete element method simulations using the experimental PSDs. The results indicate that smaller particles and broader PSDs experience higher stresses, whereas monodisperse systems do not exhibit significant stress fluctuations with position or particle size. This suggests that the high strain observed cannot be attributed solely to smaller particles, but rather to size inhomogeneity. Overall, these findings highlight that both particle size and its distribution play a critical role in processing solid electrolytes for solid\u2010state batteries.",

The electrode demonstrates ultralow capacity decay during long\u2010term cycling in both potassium\u2010 and sodium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPotassium\u2010ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are promising next\u2010generation energy storage technologies because of their abundant and low\u2010cost raw materials. However, anodes for PIBs/SIBs often exhibit poor cycling stability, mainly due to particle fragmentation, loss of electrical connectivity, and continuous electrolyte decomposition from repetitive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these challenges, a biomimetic pomegranate\u2010like core\u2010shell SnP2O7@PC anode (CSP\u2010SnP2O7@PC) is synthesised through pyrolysis\u2010driven Kirkendall effect of tin\u2010based phosphonate metal\u2010organic framework (MOF). This multi\u2010scale design integrates several key features. At the molecular scale, the in situ formation of Sn\u2010P\u2010O bonds reduces K+ diffusion barriers. The nanoscale dispersion of SnP2O7 within conductive carbon matrix promotes efficient electron and ion transport. Furthermore, microscale structural engineering creates pre\u2010reserved voids to accommodate volume expansion, suppress SEI overgrowth, and prevent cracking.

However, their application is often limited by insufficient stability resulting from excessive swelling. This work presents a strategy to achieve efficient, safe and stable operation of a 24 \u00b5m thin hydrocarbon membrane by combining a modified polymer structure with a reinforcement layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHydrocarbon (HC) membranes have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of water electrolyzers. However, their low mechanical integrity under electrolysis conditions, due to severe swelling, poses a challenge for industrial\u2010scale applications. Here, we present a 12\u00a0\u00b5m\u2010thick sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPPS) membrane reinforced with a porous polyethylene (PE) substrate. The PE substrate reduces in\u2010plane swelling by a factor of 7 (10% vs 69%) and improves mechanical stability (440\u00a0MPa vs 50\u00a0MPa) in water at 60\u00b0C. Under electrolysis conditions, a 24\u00a0\u00b5m thick sandwich of two reinforced membranes shows stable operation over more than 2000\u00a0h in a constant current hold at 1\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122 conducted at 60\u00b0C (first 1000 h) and 80\u00b0C (remaining 1000 h) with only 6\u00a0\u00b5V\u00a0h\u22121 of voltage deviation within the last 500 h. With a potential of 1.67\u00a0V and a hydrogen in oxygen content of 1\u00a0vol% at 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122, the PFAS\u2010free membrane clearly outperforms a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art reference (Nafion\u2010N211: 1.73\u00a0V and 1.5\u00a0vol% at 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122).",

Electrochemical discharge better preserves the composition and layered structure of Ni\u2010rich cathode materials while minimizing residual lithium compounds. These findings highlight electrochemical discharge as a promising preprocessing step for closed\u2010loop direct recycling of lithium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption has significantly boosted the demand for lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), creating an urgent need for sustainable recycling strategies. Discharging end\u2010of\u2010life LIBs is a critical preprocessing step before recycling. Electrical discharge via cables is the current industrial state of the art for large battery packs, whereas electrochemical discharge (discharging batteries in solutions) offers a reliable alternative for smaller and mixed waste streams. This study compares electrical and electrochemical discharge methods and examines their effects on the morphology and composition of electrode materials from spent LIBs. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of electrochemical discharge to enable a closed\u2010loop direct recycling process by recovering high\u2010quality active materials from spent LIBs. Characterization results reveal that the lithium content is higher on negative electrode sheets after electrical discharge than after electrochemical discharge. Unreacted lithium on Ni\u2010rich layered oxides can form residual lithium compounds, such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH), which can trigger undesirable side reactions. PXRD analysis indicates that positive electrode materials subjected to electrochemical discharge retain their layered structure with minimal cation mixing, unlike those subjected to electrical discharge. Overall, the findings demonstrate that electrochemical discharge is more effective in preserving the chemical composition and structural integrity of active materials than conventional electrical discharge methods.",

Quantitative MST, NMR, and GC\u2010MS analysis resolves inactive\u2010lithium species and electrolyte component loss, revealing distinct electrolyte degradation pathways and guiding safer, longer\u2010lasting fast\u2010charge battery designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium plating on graphite anodes is a critical degradation pathway in lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), yet quantitative decoupling of its contribution from normal anode aging remains challenging. Here, we designed controlled Li plating tests using negative\u2010to\u2010positive (N/P) ratio\u00a0<\u00a01 LiFePO4/graphite cells and then compared them with practical fast\u2010charging cells (N/P\u00a0>\u00a01), quantifying the decomposition of each electrolyte component (solvent, salt, additives) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry titration (MST), and gas chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry (GC\u2010MS). Controlled Li plating occurs after full graphite lithiation, and it leads to rapid vinylene carbonate (VC) depletion, time\u2010dependent non\u2010Faradaic consumption of hexafluorophosphate (PF6\u2212)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)/ethylene carbonate (EC), and more organic solid\u2010electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation at higher rates. In routine fast\u2010charging aging, Li plating occurs before graphite saturation, and we find pronounced EMC consumption under high\u2010rate conditions compared with low \u2010 rate. Our comparative analysis indicates that VC consumption during fast charging originates not only from plating but also significantly from baseline graphite aging. Li plating likely induces SEI rupture, leading to direct contact with electrolyte, thus more organic SEI formation. This quantitative study enables decoupling of Li plating\u2010induced side reactions from general aging without plating, informing battery design and predictive aging models.",

However, issues such as dendrite growth and side reactions hinder their practical adoption. Cellulose\u2010based gel electrolytes (CGEs) have recently emerged as promising materials to mitigate these challenges. By inhibiting zinc dendrite formation and enhancing interfacial stability, CGEs improve cycling longevity and safety in ZIBs. This review begins by classifying gel electrolytes and outlining the distinctive benefits of CGEs prepared via crosslinking and non\u2010crosslinking strategies. It then systematically examines recent developments in CGEs for use with various cathode materials and in multifunctional ZIBs configurations. Finally, the environmental merits and compelling electrochemical properties of CGEs are highlighted, together with a forward\u2010looking discussion on their role in next\u2010generation ZIBs and related future research directions. This work provides a timely and comprehensive resource that integrates materials design with electrochemical insights, offering valuable guidance for the rational development of CGEs.",

    "content": "High resolution electron holography was used to image the projected electric potential of ordered water layers at the interface to a platinum (111) electrode. The observed reorganization of the water layers upon applying external potentials suggests that the electric potential drop of the electric double layer is mainly carried by the polarization field of ordered water dipoles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nImaging atomic structure and electric fields of the electric double layer at electrode\u2010water interfaces is essential for understanding electrochemical reactions. The wave properties of electrons in an environmental transmission electron microscope were used to reconstruct the atomic scale electric potentials of a platinum (111) interface in water by phase shifting electron holography. This progress allowed the observation of ordered water layers at the dynamic state of the platinum (111) surface and the water reorganization under applied electric potentials. The obtained projected electric potential of the Pt\u2010water interface is quantitatively compared to ab\u2010initio molecular dynamics simulations, revealing an extended ordered water region. We conclude that the potential drop at the Pt \u2010H2O interface is mainly carried by the polarization field of the ordered water structure. The impact of different surface Pt configurations and the presence of adsorbates on the ordered structure are discussed.",

It regulates water and ion access, suppresses electrode degradation, and markedly improves cycling stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nOrganic redox materials hold great promise for sustainable energy storage due to their structural tunability and elemental abundance. However, their practical application remains hindered by rapid degradation during repeated electrochemical reactions, primarily caused by side processes involving water and unstable redox intermediates. Here, we report a metastable, rehydration\u2010stable molecular capsule formed through the interfacial self\u2010assembly of amphiphilic Pluronic F127 on hydrophobic 2\u2010ethyl\u2010anthraquinone (2\u2010E\u2010AQ) particles.

Currently, bipolar plates account for 80 % of fuel cell stack mass and 60 % of its volume. Herein, we leverage a range of advanced manufacturing techniques to develop novel lightweight\u2010compact porous distributors with ultrahigh power densities. Research begins with a graphene\u2010coated nickel foam porous distributor, which enhances reactants transport and interfacial conductivity, achieving a power density of 1.52\u00a0W/cm2, \u223c50 % improvement over conventional designs. To further boost gravimetric power density, titanium was adopted as a base material, and porous architectures were optimized using Computational Fluid Dynamics to ensure optimal reactant distribution and water management. To realize these porous titanium designs, two advanced manufacturing techniques were leveraged: laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and laser micromachining. While the optimized LPBF lattice structure reached 1.36\u00a0W/cm2, the laser\u2010patterned non\u2010homogeneous architecture demonstrated a breakthrough performance of 1.62\u00a0W/cm2, translating to volumetric and gravimetric power densities of over 10\u00a0kW/L and 9\u00a0kW/kg, respectively. These values surpass current commercial benchmarks and exceed EU/UK 2030 targets. We demonstrate how integrating digital design, flow control, advanced materials, and manufacturing enables lightweight, high\u2010power fuel cells, with broader impact on electrolyzers, heat exchangers, and batteries.",

Molecularly defined \u03b1\u2010phase seeds direct vertical perovskite crystal growth, producing uniform monolithic films over large areas. The resulting modules achieve high certified efficiency and exceptional long\u2010term outdoor stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nScaling high\u2010efficiency perovskite solar cells into commercially viable modules remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a seed\u2010primed, vacuum\u2010assisted crystallization (S\u2010VAC) strategy that links oleylamine\u2010induced \u03b1\u2010phase nanocrystal seeding to vacuum\u2010driven vertical crystal growth. Complementary in situ characterization, including time\u2010resolved GIWAXS, solution\u2010state NMR, and dynamic light scattering (DLS), reveals that oleylamine forms uniform \u22481.7\u00a0nm \u03b1\u2010phase seeds in the precursor solution via hydrogen bonding with FA+ cations and steric stabilization. These seeds prime the substrate for controlled, single\u2010crystal\u2010like vertical growth under low\u2010pressure vacuum processing, thereby eliminating the need for toxic antisolvents. The resulting monolithic perovskite films exhibit strong (100) texture and high uniformity across 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015 cm2 substrates. Using S\u2010VAC, we achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.2% for 2.5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 2.5 cm2 devices and a certified efficiency of 19.1% for 15 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 15 cm2 mini\u2010modules. Encapsulated modules retain >94% of their initial efficiency after one year of continuous outdoor operation. By establishing a molecular\u2010level basis for oleylamine\u2010assisted seed formation and demonstrating scalable, antisolvent\u2010free processing, this work advances seed\u2010assisted crystallization and supports the practical commercialization of robust and sustainable perovskite photovoltaics.",

Through co\u2010dissolution, single\u2010 and two\u2010metal separations, DESs enable sustainable recovery of critical metals for closed\u2010loop regeneration of battery\u2010grade materials, advancing a circular economy for energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe exponential growth of lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) market driven by electric vehicles has intensified the demand for sustainable and efficient recycling technologies. Among emerging solutions, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted increasing attention due to their tunable properties, low toxicity, and environmental compatibility. While DESs have been widely applied in the leaching of spent cathodes, their functions and mechanisms remain underexplored. In this review, we critically examine the stage\u2010specific roles of DESs in the recovery of lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) from spent cathodes. DES applications are systematically classified into metal co\u2010dissolution, single\u2010metal selectivity (Li\u2010first, Ni\u2010first), and two\u2010metal pairwise separations. We discuss key DES design principles for achieving metal\u2010specific selectivity, highlighting emerging hydrophobic DESs and redox\u2010active systems, and expanding roles beyond leaching (binder removal, graphite pre\u2010concentration, direct regeneration, and hydrophobic DESs for liquid\u2010liquid extraction). Finally, this review identifies major challenges limiting DES scalability, including viscosity, component stability, recyclability, impurity tolerance, and limited techno\u2010economic and life cycle analyses. We also propose future directions to fully integrated, closed\u2010loop, and sustainable DES\u2010based recycling processes for critical metals.

    "content": "Reflective semi\u2010transparent organic photovoltaics (r\u2010ST\u2010OPVs) are developed by introducing a light\u2010selective reflective layer to enhance spectral selectivity. This design enables efficient near\u2010infrared absorption while reflecting visible light, achieving a record light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 7.62%. The approach provides a promising pathway for high\u2010performance solar windows and building\u2010integrated photovoltaics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nFeaturing unique selective absorption, the semi\u2010transparent organic photovoltaics (ST\u2010OPVs) hold a bright future for building integration. However, the prevailing ST\u2010OPVs take a transmission mode (t\u2010ST\u2010OPV) and can hardly achieve a good compromise between the averaged visible transmission (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), rendering a poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) and limiting their practical application. Inspired by the optical path of a periscope, this work developed an ST\u2010OPV structure with a reflection optical path (r\u2010ST\u2010OPV), which takes dual or multiple reflections to make a transmission effect. This structure mitigates the reflection loss and significantly enhances the absorbing selectivity.

The substitution of the sulfur atom on the outer ring of the fused\u2010ring core of DC9\u2010HD with a selenium atom resultes in the red\u2010shifted DYSe\u20103. Despite these minor differences, DC9\u2010HD and DYSe\u20103 possess nearly identical conjugated skeletons, which contribute to their similar packing motifs and crystallinities, ultimately enabling a high degree of miscibility between two DMAs. Upon incorporating DYSe\u20103 into the host PM6:DC9\u2010HD binary blend, fibril\u2010like morphologies featured with diameters of \u224816.9\u00a0nm and reduced charge recombination are observed in the PM6:DC9\u2010HD:DYSe\u20103 ternary blend. More importantly, owing to their long exciton diffusion lengths and low voltage losses, a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.4% is achieved for the ternary OSCs, alongside a delicate balance between open\u2010circuit voltage and short\u2010circuit current density. This super result is comparable to the best performance of oligomer acceptor based OSCs reported to date. Furthermore, the proposed ternary strategy, which combines one polymer donor and two well\u2010compatible DMAs, not only retains the advantages of DMAs but also offers a streamlined approach for fabricating high\u2010performance ternary OSCs.",

Large diffusion length are obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nLong exciton diffusion length (LD) is key to maximizing excitation harvesting in organic solar cells, but contradicting values are reported for non\u2010fullerene acceptors (NFA). To understand the factors enabling large LD, experimental observation of exciton decay by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is combined with microscopic Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations on 4 ITIC derivatives. Exciton decays are fitted considering singlet exciton\u2010singlet exciton annihilation (SSA) and the intrinsic exciton's lifetime \u03c4, resulting in LD from 20 to 70 nm. The critical importance of an independent estimate of \u03c4 is discussed and its measurements from pristine NFA films is found to be more relevant than from NFA molecules embedded in an inert polystyrene matrix. From experimental parameters, the microscopic F\u00f6rster Resonant Energy Transfer hopping rate and the annihilation rate in a cubic lattice are determined, considering a Gaussian energetic disorder. KMC simulation of those rates are able to reproduce the experimental transients and LD, provided a lattice constant a close to the molecular \u03c0\u2010\u03c0 stacking distance is used. It is found that this tight packing and a low disorder are critical to reach large LD, and empirically relate linearly such that 40 meV more disorder can be compensated by 1 Angstrom tighter packing (shorter a).",

By analyzing the thin film microstructure using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a significant phase separation is observed in the Y6\u2010based blend, compared to PTQ10:Y12 and FO6\u2010T:Y12, and a clear red\u2010shift in the UV\u2013vis profile. The superior stability of the FO6\u2010T:Y12 blend is attributed to less morphological degradation upon aging and the increased number of photogenerated charges upon degradation. Finally, through a series of light intensity and temperature\u2010dependent J\u2013V characterizations, we evaluated the recombination mechanisms.",

Thickness\u2010resilient donor:acceptor blends are, however, scarce and not fully understood. The interplay between electronic, optical, and microstructural properties of the photoactive layer (PAL) generates a multi\u2010parametric space where rationalization is far from trivial. In this work, high\u2010throughput experimentation, simulations, and machine learning (ML) methods are leveraged to provide material and device insights toward thickness\u2010resilient OPVs. From a database of 720 inverted devices and 20 different donor:acceptor blends, two main blend families are identified in terms of their resilience against increased PAL thickness (>200\u00a0nm). These are archetypically represented by PBDB\u2010T:ITIC (thickness\u2010sensitive) and PTQ10:Y6 (thickness\u2010resilient). Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations elucidate that the blend morphology alone, either in the form of an effective medium or energy cascade, can explain the experimental short\u2010circuit current density and open\u2010circuit voltage trends without tweaking the recombination parameters (cf. drift\u2010diffusion, DD). High fill factors (FFs) in thick\u2010film devices cannot, however, be reproduced by the kMC or DD simulations. ML models show that complementary absorbing donors and acceptors (shifted absorption onsets) mixed in balanced weight ratios provide a favorable hole back\u2010transfer efficiency to increase the FF in thick\u2010film devices.",

Increased chlorine dispersion leads to enhanced efficiency through improved exciton dissociation, reduced recombination, and ameliorative molecular packing for better charge transfer, emphasizing its key role in boosting organic photovoltaic performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis study focuses on the synthesis and the performance of non\u2010fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with varying chlorine dispersion in organic solar cells (OSCs). Four chlorine\u2010mediated acceptors, BO3Cl\u2010a, BO3Cl\u2010\u03b3, BO3Cl\u2010\u03b2, and BOEH3Cl\u2010\u03b2 are synthesized with isomeric terminal groups and then integrated with donor PBDB\u2010TF to fabricate OSCs. It finds that increased chlorine dispersion improves device efficiency with enhanced current and BOEH3Cl\u2010\u03b2\u2010based devices achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19%, which is one of the highest values reported for asymmetrically chlorinated acceptors. In OSC devices, Enhanced exciton dissociation and reduced carrier recombination are observed with more chlorine dispersion, along with improved charge transport due to modulation of molecular packing in the active layer. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy elucidates that chlorine dispersion augments exciton diffusion time, thereby elevating the current density of devices, while the branching strategy further amplify the exciton lifetime of BOEH3Cl\u2010\u03b2, preserving the value of short current in the face of spectral blue shifts of it. The findings suggest that chlorine\u2010mediated dispersion is a key factor in enhancing OSC performance with improved current by progressive molecular packing arrangement and aggregation behaviors.",

    "content": "Organic photovoltaics are a promising solar cell technology, but even the record devices with 20% efficiency have significant fill factor losses due to low active layer conductivities. In this Perspective, the authors describe the origin of these losses, discuss experimental methods for their quantification, and explain how to minimize them to optimize charge collection in organic solar cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOrganic photovoltaics (OPV) are a promising solar cell technology well\u2010suited to mass production using roll\u2010to\u2010roll processes. The efficiency of lab\u2010scale solar cells has exceeded 20% and considerable attention is currently being given to understanding and minimizing the remaining loss mechanisms preventing higher efficiencies. While recent efficiency improvements are partly owed to reducing non\u2010radiative recombination losses at open circuit, the low fill factor (FF) due to a significant transport resistance is becoming the Achilles heel of OPV. The term transport resistance refers to a voltage and light intensity\u2010dependent charge collection loss in low\u2010mobility materials. In this perspective, it is demonstrated that even the highest efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) reported to\u2010date have significant performance losses that can be attributed to transport resistance and that lead to high FF losses. A closer look at the transport resistance and the material properties influencing it is provided. How to experimentally characterize and quantify the transport resistance is described by providing easy to follow instructions. Furthermore, the causes and theory behind transport resistance are detailed. In particular, the relevant figures\u00a0of merit (FoMs) and different viewpoints on the transport resistance are integrated. Finally, we outline strategies that can be followed to minimize these charge collection losses in future solar\u00a0cells.",

Herein, we report the rational design and green synthesis of a heterocycle\u2010bridged short sulfur\u2010chain polymer, namely poly(pyrazine tetrasulfide) (PPZTS), with a sulfur\u2010rich atomic chain structure as a high\u2010performance cathode material for lithium\u2010organosulfide batteries. The pyrazine\u2010bridged short sulfur\u2010chain structure in PPZTS prevents the formation and shuttling of long\u2010chain polysulfides, and the electronegative \u03c0\u2010conjugated pyrazine rings facilitate uniform Li+ diffusion, leading to significant improvements in both cycling stability and rate performance. The PPZTS cathode achieves a high capacity of 1250 mAh g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121 and 660 mAh g\u22121 at 5.0 A g\u22121. When cycled at 1.0 A g\u22121, the PPZTS cathode demonstrates an initial capacity of 850.9 mAh g\u22121 and retaining 630.4 mAh g\u22121 after 400 cycles. The PPZTS cathode also demonstrates robust performance across a wide temperature range from \u221220 to 80\u00b0C, and the deployment in soft\u2010packed batteries further suggests its potential practicability. This work underscores the intriguing potential of heterocycle\u2010linked short sulfur\u2010chain polymers as cathode materials for alkali metal\u2010organosulfide batteries, addressing key challenges in organosulfur polymer applications for advanced energy storage devices.",

    "content": "DLM@SA@Zn composite electrolyte delivers fast zinc diffusion kinetics and strong interaction with polyiodides, which physically separates the redox reactions of metallic zinc to Zn2+ ions (Zn anode side) and iodine to iodides (AC@I2 cathode side), effectively endows the uniform zinc deposition, and eliminates the active iodine dissolution and polyiodide shuttle during the cycling process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nCombining the high ionic conductivity of inorganic filler with the robust strength of organic matrix is a valid strategy to boost the ion transport and interface stability of composite solid electrolyte, which effectively inhibits dendrite growth of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathode for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, DLM@SA@Zn quasi\u2010solid\u2010state electrolytes (QSSEs) are constructed by sodium alginate (SA) and dolomite (DLM) through self\u2010assembly film technology, and delivers wide operating voltage window (3.08\u00a0V), high ionic conductivity (2.22 mS cm\u22121), and high Zn2+ transference number (0.84). For the Zn//AC@I2 cells in DLM@SA@Zn electrolyte, a high\u2010capacity retention ratio of 82.48% is achieved after 22\u2009000 cycles at 1 A g\u22121, and a high reversible capacity of 162.7 mAh g\u22121 is maintained after 250 cycles at 0.5 A g\u22121 under high temperature of 60\u00b0C. These outstanding performances can be attributed to the low zinc diffusion energy barriers, superior structural stability, and strong polyiodide adsorption capability, consequently guaranteeing uniform Zn deposition, ignorable iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle\u2010free behavior. Furthermore, Zn//NH4V4O10 cells also exhibit a high\u2010capacity retention ratio of 81% after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g\u22121 in DLM@SA@Zn electrolyte, highlighting its promising application potential in ZMBs, and providing new insights for the rational design of QSSEs.",

Their favorable redox potential, compatibility with aluminum current collectors, and stable SEI formation provide unique advantages, though the large ionic radius of K+ poses challenges for designing stable and high\u2010capacity anodes. This review categorizes KIB anodes into five classes\u2014alloy\u2010based, intercalation\u2010type, conversion\u2010type, conversion\u2013intercalation hybrids, and organic systems\u2014and critically evaluates their redox mechanisms, electrochemical performance, and structural evolution. Beyond the active materials, we highlight the often\u2010overlooked but crucial influence of electrolyte formulations (e.g., potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6), potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI), or concentrated electrolytes) and binder chemistries in governing solid electrolyte interface (SEI) stability, ion transport, and electrode durability. We also discuss recent commercialization efforts, including Natron Energy's Prussian blue\u2013based systems, and outline a forward\u2010looking roadmap that integrates materials innovation with electrode\u2013electrolyte engineering and sustainability principles. By bridging mechanistic understanding with industrial perspectives, this review provides guidance for advancing KIBs toward practical, environmentally responsible energy storage solutions.",

    "content": "Enhanced carbophobicity of Cu catalyst was obtained via doping impressive electronegativity Pb element, which steered the hydrogenation site at \u03b2\u2010C of *CH2CHO intermediates, preserving the C\u2500O bond and achieving excellent ethanol formation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochemical CO reduction to ethanol offers a sustainable route for carbon utilization, but the uncontrollable hydrogenation pathway in post C\u2500C coupling limits its selectivity. Herein, we introduced Pb doping to modulate the carbophobicity of Cu catalyst, thereby directing hydrogenation toward the \u03b2\u2010C of the key *CH2CHO intermediate and boosting ethanol production. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pb incorporation reduced electron transfer from Cu to *CH2CHO, weakening the Cu\u2500C bond and favoring the \u03b2\u2010C hydrogenation over the ethylene pathway. In situ X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Pb doping lowered the electron density at Cu sites, resulting in weakened CO adsorption, consistent with a carbophobic catalyst surface. In situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy further revealed suppressed CO coverage and enhanced accumulation of ethanol\u2010pathway intermediates (*OC2H5) on the Pb\u2010doped Cu. As a result, the optimized PbCu catalyst achieved an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 55.2% with a partial current density of \u223c500\u00a0mA cm\u22122, outperforming most reported CO reduction catalysts.

Picosecond laser surface texturing and liquid\u2010metal\u2010modified carbon electrodes synergistically enhance interfacial conformity, carrier extraction, and moisture resistance, enabling highly efficient, stable large\u2010area modules and advancing scalable, low\u2010cost perovskite photovoltaic technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAchieving a simultaneous balance of cost, efficiency, and operational stability is critical for the commercial viability of perovskite photovoltaics. Planar\u2010junction carbon\u2010based perovskite solar modules (C\u2010PSMs) represent a promising platform toward this goal, offering low\u2010cost fabrication and long\u2010term environmental stability enabled by thick carbon electrodes that eliminate the need for encapsulation. However, their power conversion efficiency remains fundamentally limited due to the discontinuous charge percolation and poor heterojunction contact at the carbon/perovskite junction. To overcome these challenges, we present a Holistic Anode Interface Design (H\u2010AID) strategy that integrates two complementary approaches. First, a picosecond laser is used to sculpt a curved perovskite surface morphology, increasing contact area and enhancing charge transfer (Design\u20101). Second, a gallium\u2010indium eutectic liquid metal is introduced into the carbon paste to fill internal voids and restore conductive pathways (Design\u20102). Their combination (Design\u20103) achieves a 42% improvement in module efficiency, reaching 16.88% over a 61.22\u00a0cm2 active area, among the highest reported for planar C\u2010PSMs. Moreover, the device retains over 95% of its initial performance after 1200 h under ambient, encapsulated conditions.
