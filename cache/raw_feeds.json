    "content": "A dual\u2010pathway strategy is proposed to enhance seawater electrolysis by incorporating SOx\u03b4\u2212 species into a Ni3S4@NiFe\u2010MOF heterostructure. Specifically, the SOx\u03b4\u2212 species coordinated with Fe sites breaks the symmetric charge distribution of Fe atoms and O ligands, for reducing the thermodynamic adsorption of Cl\u2212 ions. Simultaneously, the uncoordinated SOx\u03b4\u2212 species promote the formation of SOx\u03b4\u2212 anion\u2010rich surface layers, which repel Cl\u2212 ions through electrostatic interactions and suppress their kinetic migration. The dual\u2010pathway Cl\u2212 suppression enables highly selective and durable OER performance in alkaline seawater at industrial current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSuppressing anodic chlorine evolution while enhancing hydrogen production in seawater electrolysis requires simultaneous regulation of the Cl\u2212 adsorption behavior and inhibition of its kinetic migration. However, integrated strategies to mitigate the associated corrosive effects remain underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate a dual\u2010pathway strategy, where the Fe\u2010SOx\u03b4\u2212 bonding and the formation of SOx\u03b4\u2212 anion\u2010rich layers synergistically provide effective protection for SOx\u03b4\u2212\u2010Ni3S4@NiFe\u2010MOF/NF catalysts in seawater environments. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that partial SOx\u03b4\u2212 chemically coordinates with Fe sites, altering the local electronic structure and increasing the Cl\u2212 adsorption energy. Simultaneously, uncoordinated SOx\u03b4\u2212 leaches into the electrolyte and spontaneously forms the surface anion\u2010rich layers via polarization effect, hampering the kinetic migration of Cl\u2212. Benefiting from this dual protection, the catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 350\u00a0mV at 1.5 A cm\u22122 and superior stability over 600\u00a0h with a small decay rate of 0.93 \u00b5V h\u22121 in alkaline seawater. The assembled seawater electrolyzer presents a small cell voltage (1.74\u00a0V @ 1 A cm\u22122), high\u2010energy conversion efficiency (75.6%), and lower H2 production cost ($0.88 per GGE) than the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. The proposed dual\u2010pathway regulation strategy offers a new paradigm for the design of high\u2010performance chloride\u2010resistant catalysts.",

This device can generate high power output with great durability, and negative ions with high voltage electrostatic discharge\u2010based output, which enables moisture collecting and dust removal effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe electrostatic potential of particulate matter presents a promising avenue for energy harvesting; however, uncontrolled electrical discharge can pose ignition risks or cause damage in industrial settings. Previous approaches have relied on the introduction of additional particles or water, which limits their applicability and overlooks the hazards associated with high electric potentials. Here, we present a novel, contactless electricity generation method using only practical compressed air and a Tesla turbine structure. Leveraging electrostatic charges and the viscous force of compressed air, this system achieves peak outputs of 800\u00a0V and 2.5 A at 325\u00a0Hz without requiring any additional particles. Furthermore, the high\u2010voltage output facilitates the neutralization and collection of dust and moisture by generating negative ions. This integrated approach expands the practical potential of static electricity\u2010based energy harvesting for industrial applications.",

However, their delocalized s/p electrons and the directional nature of p orbitals result in intrinsically weak binding to ORR intermediates, limiting catalytic activity. In this study, we develop main\u2010group dual\u2010atom catalysts (DACs) based on the s\u2010block element calcium (Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS) to address this limitation. The dual\u2010atom design enables a dual\u2010channel mechanism involving \u03c3\u2010donation and \u03c0\u2010backdonation through p\u2013p orbital hybridization between Ca 3p orbitals at the Ca2 dual\u2010atom sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate enhanced p\u2013p orbital coupling between Ca 3p and O 2p states, leading to optimized p\u2010electron configurations that promote O2 activation and facilitate the adsorption of oxygen intermediates during the ORR. Notably, Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS achieves a half\u2010wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91\u00a0V and exhibits excellent four\u2010electron ORR selectivity, significantly outperforming its single\u2010atom analogue. Furthermore, Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS demonstrates exceptional durability and stable performance in Zn\u2013air batteries across a wide temperature range (\u221240\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C).

    "content": "The pre\u2010leaching of inactive oxide is proposed to decouple the coordination anion substitution from the active metal oxidation processes, moderating reconstruction of the pre\u2010catalyst. In MoO2/NixSy, the preferential formation and re\u2010adsorption of MoO42\u2212 derived from sacrificial agent (MoO2) reduces the disorder of the NiOOH active phase, enabling exceptional activity and stability for industrial\u2010grade water splitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWater electrolysis represents a promising approach for producing green hydrogen fuel from abundant renewable energy sources, offering a viable solution to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels. However, the leaching of active species from catalysts due to dynamic reconstruction poses significant durability challenges, limiting practical applications despite advances in catalytic activity. Herein, we introduce an innovative and versatile design featuring an inactive pre\u2010leaching region within the pre\u2010catalyst to decouple coordination anion substitution from active metal oxidation, thereby mitigating catalyst reconstruction. We fabricate a MoO2/NixSy system, utilizing readily oxidizable MoO2 as a sacrificial component. This design effectively isolates the coordination anion substitution (Sx\u2212\u2192OH\u2212\u2192O2\u2212) around nickel sites from the oxidative transformation of nickel atoms in NixSy. Consequently, the MoO2/NixSy system evolves into a dual oxyanion co\u2010adsorbed NiOOH, marked by low structural disorder and strong Ni\u2500O bonds for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This synergistic co\u2010adsorption enhances electron transfer, yielding an impressive overpotential of 253\u00a0mV at 1000\u00a0mA cm\u22122 and exceptional stability over 300 h. Scaled for industrial water electrolyzers, MoO2/NixSy maintains stable operation at 8000\u00a0mA for 360 h, achieving a record\u2010low voltage of 1.70\u00a0V, corresponding to energy consumption of 4.07\u00a0kWh m\u22123 H2.",

However, Ru\u2010type catalysts have suffered from unbalanced intermediate adsorption/desorption, resulting in suboptimal HOR activity and limited long\u2010term stability, particularly under practical AEMFC operating conditions. Here, we present a RuCo core\u2013shell nanoplate featuring a Co core and an atomically scaled Ru skin shell (Co@Ru NPs), in which the unique core\u2013shell structure and atomic Ru skin effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption balance of H* and OH* species while enhancing reaction kinetics in AEMFCs. Consequently, the Co@Ru NPs\u2010based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density (PPD) of 1.57\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122 in H2\u2010O2 with an ultralow Ru loading of 0.05\u00a0mg\u00a0cm\u22122, which enables an exceptional anode specific power of 31.4\u00a0W\u00a0mgRu\u22121, outperforming those of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art Ru\u2010type AEMFCs. Moreover, the Co@Ru NPs\u2010based fuel cell can be run stably at 0.5\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122 for over 300\u00a0h, demonstrating the excellent stability of Co@Ru NPs for practical fuel cell applications.",

    "content": "This review summarizes carbon species doping strategies to overcome the photocatalytic limitations of graphitic carbon nitride. Carbon doping is classified into atomic substitution, carbon ring embedding, and external carbon species. Synergistic coupling with heteroatom doping and defect engineering is discussed, emphasizing mechanisms for enhanced light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactivity, and outlining remaining challenges and future perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPhotocatalytic technology, as a representative example of chemical reactions driven by solar energy, paves a transformative path toward a sustainable energy future. However, graphitic carbon nitride (g\u2010C3N4, CN), a highly promising metal\u2010free photocatalyst, currently faces practical limitations due to inherent deficiencies in light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface reactivity. Doping modification with carbon species has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to overcome these bottlenecks. This review systematically organizes and precisely classifies carbon species doping strategies into three categories: carbon atom substitution, carbon ring embedding, and external carbon species. Building upon this foundation, this review highlights the synergistic strategies combining carbon species with other modification techniques, such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, morphology regulation, and heterostructure construction, which elucidate the advantages in overcoming the limitations of single\u2010mode carbon doping and enhancing photocatalytic performance. From an application perspective, we further discuss the critical improvements brought about by carbon\u2010species doping in light absorption, charge transfer, and surface reaction kinetics. Finally, the challenges and future directions for precisely controlling carbon species doping are outlined, which will facilitate the large\u2010scale implementation of g\u2010C3N4\u2010catalyzed energy conversion processes and promote revolutionary and diversified advancements in solar energy utilization.",

The Li\u2010ion transport mechanism and degradation mechanism are systematically investigated by combing operando technologies with MD simulations, providing critical insights for developing advanced solid\u2010state electrolyte systems and accelerating the progress of solid\u2010state Li\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid\u2010state lithium\u2010metal batteries (SSLBs) are considered as promising next\u2010generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density and substantially improved safety. However, the poor interfacial contact between electrodes and solid electrolytes leads to high internal impedance, low coulombic efficiency, and rapid capacity degradation. Herein,\u00a0a novel organic co\u2010crystal (LiDFOB\u2010SN) containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) is developed to establish cohesive contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The designed LiDFOB0.5\u2010SN electrolyte shows a wide electrochemical window (anodic reduction potential >5.2\u00a0V) and high conductivity (0.56 mS\u00b7cm\u22121 at 30\u00b0C). Assembled with this electrolyte, lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2, LCO) || Li batteries cycled between 3.0 and 4.5\u00a0V exhibit a high\u2010capacity retention of over 87% after 500 cycles. The improved high\u2010voltage cycling performance originates from the designed solid electrolytes, which reduce irreversible phase transformation in cathode materials and suppress Li dendrite growth. Furthermore, operando Raman measurements and molecular dynamics simulations are combined to explore the Li\u2010ion transport mechanism, suggesting that Li\u2010ions tend to transport along the highly conductive grain boundaries of the polycrystalline LiDFOB\u2010SN. This work provides a comprehensive insight into the operation mechanisms of organic co\u2010crystal electrolytes, which can further enable high\u2010performance solid\u2010state Li\u2010metal batteries and promote their practical applications.",

    "content": "Controlling the assembly of atomically\u2010thin nanosheets has remained elusive. Li et\u00a0al. reveal that van der Waals interactions, rather than thermal motion, prevent magnetic alignment. They develop a predictive low\u2010field strategy with quantitative parameter matching, enabling sculpting of two\u2010dimensional (2D) architectures from horizontal to vertical orientations. Vertically aligned MXene electrodes demonstrate exceptional energy storage performance, establishing a universal platform for functional 2D materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nControlling the macroscopic assembly of two\u2010dimensional (2D)\u00a0nanosheets into functional, ordered architectures is a central challenge in materials science. Their intrinsic tendency to restack into dense, disordered films severely limits their potential in applications requiring directional transport, from catalysis to energy storage. Aligning atomically\u2010thin nanosheets has remained a major hurdle, a failure previously ascribed to thermal motion but which we identify as stemming from dominant, many\u2010body van der Waals interactions creating deep kinetic traps. Here, we overcome this barrier with a magnetic strategy enabling predictive architectural control at low field strengths (<50 mT). We establish a parameter\u2010matching model that deciphers the complex energy landscape, transforming assembly into a rational design framework. This approach allows us to sculpt architectures like vertically aligned, biaxially ordered MXene structures, creating ion superhighways with minimized tortuosity. As a demonstration, engineered MXene electrodes deliver exceptional rate capabilities in supercapacitors and sodium\u2010ion batteries. This work provides a universal, scalable platform for architecting 2D materials, unlocking their potential where directional transport is paramount.",

    "content": "A molecular\u2010level design strategy coupling nitrogen modulation with controlled oxidative crosslinking is proposed to prepare asphalt\u2010derived hard carbon, which simultaneously enhances structural stability, promotes ultrafast electron/Na+ transport, and induces the formation of a thin NaF\u2010rich SEI, thereby achieving high capacity, excellent rate performance, and long\u2010term cycling, as validated in Ah\u2010level cylindrical cells. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAsphalt is an attractive precursor for hard carbon anodes in sodium\u2010ion batteries owing to its low cost and excellent structural consistency. However, conventional oxidative strategies, commonly employed for converting asphalt into hard carbon, inevitably distorts the carbon framework, disrupting electronic continuity and Na\u207a diffusion, thereby limiting rate capability. Herein, an integrated molecular\u2010level strategy is developed by coupling controlled oxidative crosslinking with simultaneous nitrogen modulation, enabling rapid electron/ion transport and delivering outstanding electrochemical performance, as validated in Ah\u2010level cylindrical cells. Combined with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we uncover that synergistic graphitic and pyrrolic nitrogen species markedly enhance structural stability and charge transport\u2014with the electronic conductivity reaching 41.9\u00a0S\u00a0cm\u22121 (1.5 \u00d7 higher) and ionic conductivity up to 0.87\u00a0mS\u00a0cm\u22121 (1.4 \u00d7 higher)\u2014while inducing the formation of a thin, NaF\u2010rich solid electrolyte interface that collectively promotes ultrafast Na+ migration and long\u2010term stability. As a result, the modulated hard carbon achieves a high capacity of 361.8\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121, excellent rate capability (190.3\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g\u22121 at 5.0\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121), and superior cycling stability.

The various notions concerning the safety of LIBs and their large\u2010scale use in our day\u2010to\u2010day lives call for a reliable alternative to them. The absence of a suitable anode and electrolyte severely limits advancements in this field. Many Ti\u2010based anode materials have been successfully employed in Na\u2010based batteries. To name a few, materials like titanium dioxide (TiO2), sodium\u2010titanium oxides (Na\u2010Ti\u2010O, e.g., Na2Ti3O7), titanium disulfide (TiS2), lithium\u2010titanium oxides (Li4Ti5O12), NASICON compounds (NaTi2(PO4)3, etc. In this review, we are attempting to explore the structural modifications and variations in synthesis processes brought about by researchers in recent years on various Ti\u2010based anode materials. We have made an in\u2010depth analysis of the structural modifications that result in the cyclic stability and the overall electrochemical performance of the battery.",

    "content": "Taurine, a natural antioxidant molecule, effectively suppresses superoxide (O2\u2219\u2212) radical originated from SnO2 layer via chemical quenching effect, thereby preventing the deprotonation of organic cations (FA+) and the oxidation of halide ions (I\u2212). Taurine\u2010buried interface also forms a chemical bridge between SnO2 and FAPbI3, leading to enhanced charge extraction ability, well\u2010matched band alignment, and reduced defect sites. The incorporation of taurine into photovoltaics can achieve a higher performance and light stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAlthough perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved high certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), operational instability remains a critical obstacle to commercialization. In particular, superoxide (O2\u2219\u2212) generated at metal\u2010oxide charge\u2010transport layers rapidly decomposes perovskites by deprotonating the organic cations (FA\u207a and MA+) and therefore must be suppressed. Nevertheless, under operating illumination, the formation and diffusion of O2\u2219\u2212 are unavoidable as long as metal oxides are employed in PSCs. To address this, we introduce the natural antioxidant taurine at the SnO2/FAPbI3 interface to suppress O2\u2219\u2212 diffusion via chemical radical quenching. We elucidate the taurine\u2010mediated O2\u2219\u2212 quenching mechanism through density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported by experiments. In addition, we find that I2 is concomitantly reduced to I\u2010 during the quenching process. This antioxidant interface prevents O2\u2219\u2212 induced perovskite decomposition under strongly oxidizing conditions. Moreover, the multifunctional groups of taurine form a chemical bridge between SnO2 and FAPbI3, reducing interfacial defect density, enhancing carrier mobility, and suppressing non\u2010radiative recombination. Consequently, the taurine\u2010buried interface enables an improved PCE with increased open\u2010circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), while markedly enhancing the light\u2010soaking and operational stability of PSCs.",

    "content": "A biodegradable PLA/PEG composite separator tackles two critical issues in high\u2010nickel batteries. Its ether\u2010oxygen groups actively chelate and immobilize transition\u2010metal ions to halt interfacial degradation, while PEG accelerates the hydrolytic breakdown of the PLA matrix for rapid environmental decomposition, enabling a Graphite || NCM811 full cell to achieve 70.4% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile high\u2010nickel cathodes offer compelling energy density, their cycle life is severely compromised by transition metal (TM) dissolution and subsequent interfacial degradation at the anode. Herein, we engineer a fully biodegradable composite separator comprising poly(lactic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA/PEG) to address these issues through multifunctional integration. The ether\u2010oxygen\u2010rich PEG chains not only effectively scavenge dissolved TM ions through strong Lewis acid\u2010base interactions and enhance interfacial ion transport, but also facilitate hydrolytic breakdown of the PLA matrix, collectively contributing to a self\u2010mediating interphase, while the mutually\u2010reinforced degradability of both polymers ensures environmental benignity. The Graphite || NCM811 full cell employing the PLA/PEG separator demonstrates exceptional cyclability, retaining 70.4% capacity after 2000 cycles at 5 C with a cathode loading of 10.56\u00a0mg cm\u22122. This work presents a paradigm of eco\u2010adaptive separator design that concurrently enhances electrochemical durability and environmental sustainability.",

However, the aging mechanism between halide SSEs and Ni\u2010rich cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1\u2212x\u2212yO2, NCM) remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigate the state\u2010of\u2010charge (SoC)\u2010dependent aging behavior of LIC/NCM composite cathodes and reveal a non\u2010monotonic relationship between SoC and capacity retention after aging. Severe capacity loss occurs under both low\u2010 and high\u2010SoC conditions, whereas high capacity retention is achieved after aging at a mid\u2010range SoC. Comprehensive structural and chemical analyses uncover a synergistic aging mechanism: reductive decomposition of LIC dominates aging at low SoCs, while structural degradation of NCM accounts for aging at high SoCs. Furthermore, an ultrathin coating layer introduced onto the NCM particle surface via atomic layer deposition effectively suppresses interfacial reactions and enhances electrochemical stability, particularly during low\u2010SoC storage. This work provides mechanistic insights into SoC\u2010dependent interfacial aging in halide\u2010based ASSBs and proposes both SoC management and interface engineering strategy to extend their calendar life.",

    "content": "On the basis of decoupled interference between solvent cointercalation and solvent decomposition, employing additives that can form an SEI layer at a potential higher than the onset voltage of solvent cointercalation is demonstrated efficient to suppress the cointercalation reaction, thus guranteeing favorable electrochemical compatibility between functionalized electrolyte and graphite anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGraphite anodes have severe compatibility issues with most non\u2010aqueous electrolytes, which is known as a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). The reduction of non\u2010aqueous solvents on graphite anodes involves complex processes, mainly including solvent co\u2010intercalation and decomposition. While much research focuses on solvent decomposition and the related solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, investigations into solvent co\u2010intercalation are limited to solvents with high reductive stability (i.e., ethers). Herein, we demonstrate that reversible solvent co\u2010intercalation is an universal side reaction threatening the stability of the graphite anode. Besides ether\u2010based solvents, the reversible co\u2010intercalation into graphite can be achieved by three commonly used functional solvents, Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), Triethyl phosphate (TEP), and Tetramethylene sulfone (TMS). By systematically analyzing these reversible solvent co\u2010intercalation reactions, the solvating power of the solvent and Li+ solvation structure were found to be the two critical factors determining the onset voltage of solvent cointercalation. The approaches to effectively protecting graphite from solvent cointercalation were also discussed. This work provides new insights into the understanding of electrolyte||graphite anode interface and shed lights into the development of high\u2010performance electrolytes for LIBs.",

    "content": "This work presents a molecular\u2010bridged (MB) hybrid SEI to prevent interphase delamination under high areal capacity. By constructing hybrid SEI via dual silane coupling agents, the MB\u2010stabilized Li metal realizes dense and homogeneous deposition even at 10 mAh cm\u22122 and maintains chemical stability during calendar aging. This MB\u2010derived SEI strategy achieves enhanced deposition/dissolution reversibility and cycling performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe practical implementation of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) requires overcoming the challenges posed by unstable interphase between Li metal and electrolyte, particularly under high areal capacities. Continuous chemical corrosion and non\u2010uniform plating/stripping degrade the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing rapid capacity loss and safety risks. Herein, we propose a molecular bridged (MB) hybrid interphase integrated with dual silane coupling agents, enabling highly reversible Li anodes at high areal capacities in carbonate\u2010based electrolyte. The MB layer tightly anchors Li metal by chemical bonding, prevents delamination during high\u2010capacity Li deposition/dissolution, and decouples parasitic reaction from Li deposition by an anti\u2010corrosive coupling network. Consequently, the MB\u2010stabilized Li anode achieves an impressive cycling for 600\u00a0h at 1\u00a0mA cm\u22122, and 8 mAh cm\u22122, and sustains 474 cycles at 1 C with 80% capacity retention in Li||LiFePO4 full cell. Furthermore, an Ah\u2010level pouch cell with high cathode loading (NCM811, \u2248 45.9\u00a0mg cm\u22122) maintains stable cycling at low N/P ratios (\u22481.87). This strategy for constructing a molecular\u2010bridged interphase offers a new perspective for maintaining the artificial SEI integrity under harsh conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of durable, high\u2010performance LMBs with reduced Li loss.",

    "content": "This study proposes a strain-based approach to address passive failures in lithium-ion batteries, which present spontaneous safety risks often indistinguishable from routine degradation using conventional diagnostics. By establishing a strain-failure correlation, we introduce a slope-based threshold and a failure-proximity index to characterize degradation-to-failure transitions. Incorporating strain-informed machine learning, it effectively detects early failure onset and estimates proximity. This scalable approach is suitable for real-time, onboard monitoring, supporting safer and more reliable battery operation.",
