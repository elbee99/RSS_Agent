    "content": "In this work, a self\u2010restructuring Fe\u2010based perovskite catalyst is developed, leveraging in situ amorphization to achieve a \u201cself\u2010improving\u201d behavior for hydrogen evolution. When integrated into a custom\u2010built membrane\u2010less electrolyzer, the system demonstrates a record\u2010breaking 1000\u00a0h stability, providing a robust and practical pathway for the development of next\u2010generation water electrolysis technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBalancing stability and activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis remains challenging for advanced electrolysis technologies. This work introduces a synergistic design strategy to tackle the challenge with in situ surface restructuring. Fe\u2010based double perovskite is developed with an optimal electronic structure for HER catalysis, delivering an overpotential of 325\u00a0mV in 0.1\u00a0m KOH and 184\u00a0mV in 1\u00a0m KOH at 10\u00a0mA/cm2, among the best reported. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited remarkable self\u2010improving stability, with specific activity increasing 1.98 times at 300\u00a0mV overpotential after 20 h, due to the restructuring of an amorphous layer confirmed with transmission electron microscopy. To demonstrate practical utility, the catalyst was integrated into an active flow membraneless electrolyzer (AFME), a promising technology that is currently limited by instability. The device demonstrated outstanding operational stability for 1000 h at 50\u00a0mA/cm2, with a minimal decay rate of 0.25\u00a0mV/h, establishing a new benchmark for membraneless systems. This work not only presents a powerful strategy for designing self\u2010improving catalysts but also validates its practical efficacy in next generation electrolyzer technologies, paving the way for cost\u2010effective green hydrogen production.",

    "content": "This review summarizes how multiscale interface regulation, through synergistic optimization, improves the performance of critical battery components, including zinc anode coatings, separators, and hydrogel electrolytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc\u2010ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large\u2010scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their commercialization is hampered by notorious zinc anode issues, including uncontrolled dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions. Multiscale interfacial regulation has recently emerged as a transformative strategy to address these challenges. This approach overcomes the limitations of single\u2010interface modulation by constructing multilayer structures and optimizing interface coupling, thereby providing effective anode protection. To promote uniform zinc plating and suppress side reactions, this review comprehensively summarizes multiscale strategies that span the optimization of multi\u2010physical fields, zinc deposition orientation, and electrolyte solvation structures. We systematically present recent advances in applying these multiscale strategies to zinc foil, zinc powder, and host\u2010based anodes, as well as separators and hydrogel electrolytes, with a focus on their design principles, underlying mechanisms, and scenario\u2010specific applicability. Furthermore, we elucidate how this technology achieves synergistic optimization of ion transport, deposition behavior, and the interfacial environment through functionally complementary multilayer, Janus, or gradient interfaces, thereby systematically mitigating zinc anode failure. Finally, future research directions and challenges are discussed, emphasizing that a profound mechanistic understanding coupled with rational design is pivotal for unlocking the full potential of next\u2010generation AZIBs.",

    "content": "Simplified Y6\u2010analogs featuring vinylene\u2010bridged DA\u2032D cores enable high\u2010efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) processed entirely under ambient air. The BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F\u2010based devices achieve a certified PCE of 19.0% with outstanding thermal and photostability, demonstrating that rational acceptor design can overcome the efficiency\u2013stability trade\u2010off and advance scalable, eco\u2010friendly OSC manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAchieving high efficiency and long\u2010term stability under ambient processing conditions remains a critical hurdle for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we report two new Y6\u2010analogs\u2014BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F (4F) and BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104Cl (4Cl)\u2014featuring vinylene (v)\u2010bridged DA\u2032D cores, designed to improve the material's scalability while maintaining the structural advantages of Y6\u2010type acceptors. Morphological and device\u2010level investigations reveal that these M\u2010Y6 derivatives facilitate thermodynamically stable molecular packing and favorable crystalline orientation, even when fully processed in air. Incorporation of 4F into a layer\u2010by\u2010layer ternary architecture with D18/L8\u2010BO via a reproducible air\u2010processing protocol results in a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%, among the highest reported for conventional OSCs fabricated under ambient conditions. Moreover, 4F\u2010based devices demonstrate exceptional thermal and photostability, retaining over 80% of their initial PCE after extended aging under the ISOS\u2010L\u20101 protocol without encapsulation. These improvements are attributed to the enhanced crystallinity, vertical molecular alignment, and morphological robustness imparted by the 4F acceptor. This study identifies BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F as a promising air\u2010processable acceptor for scalable OSCs that combine high efficiency with long\u2010term operational durability.",

    "link": "https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202506618?af=R",
    "content": "This work presents Echo\u2010vision, a compact and deformable ultrasonic platform that integrates acoustic energy harvesting and echo imaging. A piezoelectric transducer, a stretchable meta\u2010lens, and a mechanical iris jointly enable controllable focusing. The harvested energy can be stored to power micro\u2010LEDs and micro\u2010motors, while the tunable focus supports varifocal imaging with subwavelength resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nUltrasonic technologies enable imaging, detection, and communication across biomedical and underwater applications, yet rigid architectures with fixed focusing often limit multifunctional integration and depth\u2010of\u2010field control. Conventional systems typically trade off aperture, coverage, and resolution, without considering unified power capture and imaging. Here, we present the prototype of Echo\u2010vision, a bio\u2010inspired ultrasonic platform that unifies acoustic energy harvesting and varifocal imaging in a single mechanically reconfigurable design. Mimicking ocular mechanisms, Echo\u2010vision combines an active device, a stretchable meta\u2010lens, and a mechanically actuated iris to realize controllable wavefront engineering and bidirectional electro\u2010acoustic conversion. In the energy harvesting mode, focused ultrasound charged five 1000 \u00b5F capacitors to 2.25\u00a0V at an average charging rate of 10 \u00b5C/s, providing sufficient power to drive micro\u2010LEDs and micro\u2010motors. In the echo imaging mode, radial stretching relocates the focal plane from 10 to 20\u00a0mm, enabling varifocal imaging at multiple depths. Raster\u2010scanned reconstructions achieve subwavelength lateral (\u223c0.8\u03bb) and wavelength\u2010scale axial (1\u03bb) resolution. This dual\u2010function integration paves the way toward self\u2010powered acoustic systems for underwater exploration, soft\u2010robotic perception, and intelligent sensing.",

The photoanode achieves 6.36 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 at 1.23 V vs RHE with \u2248 120 h stability in neutral phosphate electrolyte, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and durable PEC water splitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolar\u2010driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting offers a sustainable route to solar\u2010to\u2010fuel conversion; however, its practical application is hindered by sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and severe surface charge recombination. BiVO4 (BVO) is a promising photoanode material but suffers from inefficient charge separation and limited operational stability. Herein, we report a dual\u2010catalyst strategy in which cobalt\u2010incorporated hydroxyapatite (Co\u2010HAP) is synergistically integrated with NiFeOX nanosheets to simultaneously enhance OER activity and durability. The optimized BVO/NiFeOX/Co\u2010HAP photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 6.36 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 at 1.23\u00a0V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination in neutral phosphate electrolyte, nearly sevenfold higher than pristine BVO. Comprehensive analyses reveal that the NiFeOX/Co\u2010HAP nanosheet framework promotes efficient interfacial charge extraction, establishes a favorable surface electric field, and suppresses hole\u2010electron recombination. The 2D nanoarchitecture provides abundant Co active sites, while interfacial NiFeOX accelerates hole extraction and facilitates electron transfer from Ni to V sites, thereby mitigating V5+ dissolution. Notably, the photoanode demonstrates extended operational stability of \u2248120\u00a0h in a phosphate electrolyte. This work highlights a robust design strategy that leverages the synergistic ion\u2010exchange capacity of HAP and the charge\u2010extraction ability of NiFe catalysts to advance efficient and durable PEC water\u2010splitting systems.",

A quantitative relationship between CO spillover rate and C2+ activity is also established, defining spillover as a measurable descriptor and advancing rational interface design for high\u2010performance catalysts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nEfficient CO2\u2010to\u2010multicarbon (C2+) electroconversion is constrained by sluggish C\u2500C coupling kinetics dependent on adsorbed *CO availability. We demonstrate that direct interfacial *CO spillover across metal\u2010metal junctions, replacing conventional tandem CO diffusion, governs C2+ formation on multicomponent Cu\u2010based catalysts. By engineering CuM (M = Ag, Pd) interfaces with tuned CO\u2010binding strengths, we establish a quantitative scaling relationship between the *CO spillover rate and C2+ partial current density. The optimized Cu@Ag catalyst promotes rapid *CO transfer from Ag to adjacent Cu sites, lowering the C\u2500C coupling barrier and achieving \u223c90% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at 600\u00a0mA cm\u22122 in a flow cell. Crucially, cyclic voltammetry under CO and operando attenuated total reflectance surface\u2010enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy directly capture dynamic *CO migration and the emergence of *COCHO intermediates, providing explicit experimental evidence for spillover\u2010driven C\u2500C coupling beyond a conceptual model.

    "content": "To address the critical challenge of interfacial instability in lithium metal anodes, this study develops LiNO2 as a novel and effective electrolyte additive. Possessing notably higher nitrogen content than LiNO3, LiNO2 can preferentially decompose to form a dense Li3N\u2010rich SEI film, thereby effectively enhancing interfacial ion transport and significantly improving overall battery performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium metal anodes (LMAs) are ideal for next\u2010generation high\u2010energy\u2010density batteries, owing to their low redox potential and high theoretical capacity. However, the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) induces severe interfacial instability, which fundamentally limits practical implementation. Lithium nitride (Li3N) has emerged as an SEI critical component due to its exceptional ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness, yet achieving high Li3N content in SEI remains challenging, as conventional additives (e.g., LiNO3) predominantly yield low\u2010conductivity Li2O during decomposition, severely limiting Li3N enrichment. To address this, we develop LiNO2 as a novel electrolyte additive. Possessing higher nitrogen content than LiNO3, LiNO2 can preferentially decompose faster and preferentially to form a Li3N\u2010rich SEI film, thereby enhancing interfacial ion transport and significantly improving battery performance. Electrochemical testing demonstrates: LiNO2\u2010modified Li||Li symmetric cells achieve >700\u00a0h stable plating/stripping; Li||Cu cells exhibit a high Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 98.52%; Li||NCM811 full cells retain >88% capacity after 200 cycles, outperforming conventional carbonate and LiNO3\u2010containing electrolytes. This work elucidates the advantages of LiNO2 as a newly developed electrolyte additive for constructing a rich Li3N SEI for high\u2010performance lithium metal batteries.",

    "content": "A mixed ion\u2010electron conducting polymer binder, PEDOT:PSSTFSI, enhances both ionic and electronic transport in NMC\u2010based positive electrode composite (PEC) for ASSBs. Optimal polymer loading (0.33\u00a0wt.% in PEC) provides the most balanced transport, with an effective conductivities (\u03c3el/\u03c3ion) ratio closest to unity, enabling high discharge capacity at 1\u00a0C. Deviations from this balance reduce high\u2010rate performance and shorten cell lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe development of positive electrode composites (PECs) with improved ionic and electronic conductivity is critical for high\u2010performance all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs). Conventional strategies rely on tuning the ratio of cathode active material (CAM) to solid electrolyte (SE) or introducing electronic conductive additives, yet both often induce interfacial instabilities limiting long\u2010term performance. Here, mixed ionic\u2010electronic conductor, poly(3,4\u2010ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(4\u2010styrenesulfonyl(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PEDOT:PSSTFSI), is incorporated as a functional polymer (FP) binder in Li3InCl6 (LIC), forming multifunctional catholytes in a single step via one\u2010pot aqueous synthesis. Owing to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and the TFSI\u2212 functional group, PEDOT:PSSTFSI enhances electronic and ionic conductivity within the catholyte. Compared to the polymer\u2010free NMC\u2010based PEC, the incorporation of 5\u00a0wt.% FP markedly increases electrode compactness, reducing the porosity by 41.8% and yielding a twelvefold increase in effective electronic conductivity. In parallel, ionic conductivity improves substantially\u2014up to 15\u2010fold, with the highest reached at 0.6\u00a0wt.% of FP in the PEC. When tested in ASSB cells, PECs containing FP show enhanced rate capability, especially at 1\u00a0C rate with full reversibility, and deliver up to 30% higher discharge capacity at a C/20 rate compared to polymer\u2010free NMC\u2010LIC references.

    "content": "This work proposed a well\u2010designed anisotropic heterojunction electrocatalyst that structurally featured Rh nanoparticle\u2010dispersed on Cu nanoplates for efficient CH3CH2NH2 electrosynthesis under ambient conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) to industrially value\u2010added ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2) represents a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes, but its efficiency is heavily limited by sluggish water dissociation kinetics and inefficient hydrogen utilization efficiency. Herein, we orchestrate a well\u2010designed anisotropic heterojunction electrocatalyst that structurally featured Rh nanoparticle\u2010dispersed on Cu nanoplates (defined as Rh/Cu PLs) for efficient CH3CH2NH2 electrosynthesis under ambient conditions. In comparison to counterpart electrocatalysts, anisotropic Rh/Cu PLs delivered impressive electrocatalytic performance, including superior CH3CH2NH2 Faradaic efficiency of 66.1% and yield rate of 18.6\u00a0mm g\u22121 h\u22121 as well as high cycling stability. Electrocatalytic mechanism investigations revealed that Rh sites kinetically accelerated the Volmer step of water splitting to form active hydrogen species, which were spontaneously spillovered to and stabilized on Cu sites without further coupling into molecular H2. Meanwhile, heterostructure lowered the energy barriers of subsequent hydrogenation pathways and thus promoted efficient electrosynthesis of CH3CH2NH2 from CH3CN. This work thus poses an alternative route to design functional HJ structures for the formation and stabilization of active hydrogen radicals for efficient electrosynthesis of various important amines.",

Even small amounts of water vapor, such as those found in dry rooms, can cause harmful reactions in materials like Li3PS4 (LPS), producing toxic H2S gas and unstable interfaces that affect thermal stability. This study examines how moisture exposure influences the thermo\u2010electrochemical stability of LPS at the material and cell\u2010level. Using a controlled glove\u2010bag setup, we evaluated various relative humidity levels (0%, 0.5%, 1.5%, and 5%) to reflect realistic manufacturing environments. Exposure to 5% relative humidity led to significant thermal instability, driven by the accumulation of H2S and other reactive byproducts, which causes higher self\u2010heating rates and an earlier thermal runaway onset. These findings underscore the crucial role of moisture control in enhancing the safety and performance of sulfide\u2010based SSBs.",

At present, Si as an anode has been widely explored in theory and experiment, but its performance in energy storage has not yet reached the theoretical capacity limit. Here, we design a new silicon\u2013hydrogen gas (Si\u2013H2) battery combining the alloying reaction of nano Si anode with the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) of hydrogen gas (H2) cathode. Systematic electrochemical studies show that the Si\u2013H2 battery has a discharge capacity of \u223c3400 mAh g\u22121 with a discharge voltage of \u223c2.45\u00a0V, and a lifetime of more than 100 cycles. The Si\u2013H2 battery also efficiently operates from 10\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C with excellent electrochemical performance. It can achieve high\u2010rate charge and discharge of 8 C at 60\u00b0C, and can stably cycle for more than 500 h. This work provides a new concept for promoting the application of hydrogen battery in energy storage and improving the capacity utilization of Si.",

Iodo controls colloidal size, zeta potential, and crystallization kinetics, while its favorable evaporation properties enable uniform, high\u2010quality perovskite film formation, highlighting the importance of functional additive\u2010driven ink design for scalable device fabrication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next\u2010generation photovoltaics; however, translating laboratory\u2010scale efficiencies to industrial production remains limited by key challenges such as achieving high\u2010quality film and addressing solvent toxicity. To overcome these limitations, we formulate colloidal ink by incorporating iodobenzene (Iodo) as an environmentally sustainable additive into a DMSO\u2010based system, enabling scalable film fabrication via slot\u2010die coating. It is found that Iodo\u2010based additives enhance wettability, facilitate the formation of larger colloidal particles, and enable controlled solidification through solvent evaporation kinetics. Specifically, the inclusion of Iodo modulates colloidal size and evaporation behavior, which in turn reduces the effective nucleation barrier and promotes directional grain growth. This leads to the formation of dense, uniform films with improved crystallinity and minimal defects. Devices fabricated using Iodo\u2010based ink achieved an efficiency of up to 22.3% (the highest reported efficiency in a highly toxic DMF\u2010free system), encapsulated devices retaining 85% of their initial value after 1200 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and 77% after 8400 h (unencapsulated devices stored in the dark), demonstrating excellent operational and long\u2010term stability. Furthermore, the DMF\u2010free, DMSO\u2010based ink shows excellent scalability, achieving efficiencies of 21% and 19.5% for 2.7 and 31.50 cm2 modules, respectively.",
