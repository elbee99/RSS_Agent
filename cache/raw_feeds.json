A notable challenge persists in realizing multistate spintronic devices with electrical control at nanoscale. Here, we propose a breakthrough strategy for achieving bias-controlled giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for multistate memory applications. Our design uses two-dimensional (2D) half-metals hosting strongly localized spin states (LSSs) at the Fermi level as two ferromagnet layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Multiple memory states emerge from bias-driven alignment/misalignment of LSSs on two sides, generating sudden tunneling pathway changes and distinguishable TMR. First-principles quantum transport simulations on MTJs based on 2D VCl\n    <sub>\n     3\n    </sub>\n    and FeCl\n    <sub>\n     2\n    </sub>\n    reveal unprecedented bias-controlled and widely modulable TMR ratios spanning \u2212194 to 2677% and\u00a0\u2212130 to 37,424%, respectively, accompanied by rare polarity switch capabilities. Our work opens a promising route for realizing electrical control of multistate spintronics.\n   </div>\n  </section>\n </div>\n</div>"

    "content": "Abstract\nChanges in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are believed to have affected the cycling of carbon isotopes \u03b413C $\\left({\\delta }^{13}C\\right)$ in both the ocean and the atmosphere. However, understanding how AMOC changes \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) distributions in the ocean is limited, since models do not typically decompose the various processes that affect \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$. Here, a new decomposition is applied to idealized simulations of an AMOC collapse, both for glacial and preindustrial conditions. The decomposition explicitly calculates the preformed and regenerated components of \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ and separates between physical and biological effects. An AMOC collapse leads to a large and rapid decrease in \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the North Atlantic, which is due to, in about equal parts, accumulation of remineralized organic matter and changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$, both in glacial and preindustrial simulations. In the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ increases by a smaller magnitude. This increase is dominated by changes in preformed \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the glacial simulation and remineralized \u03b413CDIC ${\\delta }^{13}{C}_{\\mathit{DIC}}$ in the preindustrial simulation. An extensive evaluation of the decomposition shows that its errors are small in most cases, especially for large basin\u2010wide changes, whereas for small, local or global changes errors can be substantial. In contrast, approximations of the remineralized component based on Apparent Oxygen Utilization have large errors in most cases and are generally unreliable because they include contributions from oxygen disequilibrium."

Notwithstanding a partial synchronicity with the COVID-19 pandemic, this rapid global dissemination of more virulent GAS lineages has been promptly detected, as well as the molecular shifts underlying the observed changes in clinical patterns. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based genomic epidemiology allowed us to gain relevant insights into this upsurge as it was happening. This review integrates the canonical research publication-based approach with genomic data and metadata and identifies a subset of genomic clusters playing a major role in invasive GAS (iGAS) infections worldwide, which were named as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Global Pathogenic Lineages</span> (GPLs). The four GPLs broadly coincide with five sequence types (STs): GPL1 with ST28, GPL2 with ST15 and ST315, GPL3 with ST52, and GPL4 with ST39. While non-GPLs clusters maintain a baseline reservoir of antimicrobial\u2010resistance and virulence genes, GPLs show varying but noteworthy resistance profiles and are frequent causes of iGAS. The integration of WGS into routine diagnostics procedures is a forthcoming improvement, aimed not only at informing tailored therapy and implementing infection control strategies, but also to perform continuous surveillance. Ongoing WGS in clinical microbiology, as a matter of fact, will provide unparalleled insights into lineage emergence, transmission dynamics, and the geographic clustering of virulence and resistance determinants.</span>"

These materials incorporate living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, or algae, to enable unique functions like self-assembly, actuation, and dynamic interaction. By utilizing (micro)biological systems in material design, ELMs promise to transform industries including healthcare, construction, and agriculture. In the early phase of ELM technology development, researchers implemented a single living strain in an already established user material. However, the complexity and potential of these materials is limited by the abilities of this single strain. Even though synthetic biology brings the opportunity to add a range of nonnative bioactivities to these cells and thus the material, the increasing metabolic burden upon implementation of multiple nonnative pathways limits the capacity of a single strain. Furthermore, higher organisms and nonstandard hosts are often desired in material settings for their native physical or metabolic advantages. However these are not always straightforward to further engineer. Thus, the use of multiple, specialized strains broadens the functionalities and thus the applicability of ELMs. Multistrain ELMs are a brand-new technology, with many promising applications.</span>"

SRB\u2010specific lipids showed eightfold higher DI13C\u2010assimilation than ANME lipids, suggesting SRB directly assimilate DIC, while ANME assimilate an alternative carbon source, potentially provided by SRBs.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn cold seeps, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate\u2010reducing bacteria (SRB) oxidise methane to inorganic carbon (IC) coupled to sulphate reduction. While catabolic pathways are well resolved, carbon flow into biomass as well as the functional roles of lipid biomarkers remain unclear. We conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid\u2010SIP) experiments with Astoria Canyon sediments dominated by ANME\u20102/SRB consortia and incubated samples with either 13C\u2010labelled methane (13CH4) or dissolved IC (DI13C). Lipid\u2010specific \u03b413C analysis showed higher 13C incorporation from DI13C than from 13CH4. After 30\u2009days, \u03b413C values were up to +417\u2030 in SRB\u2010specific fatty acids (e.g., C16:1\u03c95c, cyC17:0\u03c95,6) and +126\u2030 in ANME\u20102\u2010specific isoprenoid lipids (e.g., archaeol, crocetane). Based on these values, we calculated carbon assimilation rates and found that both partners primarily assimilate IC. Remarkably, IC assimilation in SRB lipids was eight times higher than in ANME lipids, suggesting that ANME may use additional yet\u2010to\u2010be\u2010identified carbon sources, potentially produced by their partner SRB. By examining the stepwise 13C\u2010enrichment of ANME\u2010 and SRB\u2010derived lipids, we further delineate biosynthetic pathways for archaeal and bacterial diether lipid formation and highlight crocetane as a bilayer\u2010modulating isoprenoid hydrocarbon potentially affecting membrane fluidity and proton permeability."

    "link": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JG009072?af=R",
    "content": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the balance between denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in riparian systems is essential for managing watershed nitrogen (N) budgets and evaluating restoration practices. This balance is influenced by several factors including concentrations and ratio of various organic and inorganic electron donors (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Fe2+) to acceptor (NO3\u2212). In riparian sediments, these factors can change rapidly over space and time, complicating measurement and quantification. We used a PFLOTRAN batch reactor model calibrated to laboratory microcosm experiments where the denitrification and DNRA rates in riparian sediments were measured using 15N stable isotopes. Although DOC/NO3\u2212 ratios influenced the relative proportions of denitrification and DNRA, the processes were also affected by elemental concentrations. For a starting DOC concentration of 0.12\u00a0mgL\u22121, DNRA exceeded denitrification at DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a06; however, this shift was not observed within a range of DOC/NO3\u2212\u00a0=\u00a030 at higher DOC concentration of 12\u00a0mgL\u22121. Heterotrophic pathways dominated NO3\u2010N reduction with smaller contribution from autotrophic pathways. These findings suggest that although heterotrophic pathways are important in carbon\u2010rich sediments, autotrophic pathways can be significant in carbon\u2010depleted conditions in the presence of inorganic electron donors such as Fe2+. Our simulations also highlighted key challenges with constraining model rate constants and parameters and the need for site specific calibrations. This work highlights the value of process\u2010based modeling in quantifying denitrification\u2010DNRA partitioning and the variable controls of electron donors and acceptors. Such simulations could be extended to riparian buffers to determine if they are effective management sinks for N mitigation."

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study studies the predictability of the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) for the eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) over the past 142\u00a0years from 1880\u20132021 by exploring its fastest error growth. This is implemented by applying the climate\u2010relevant singular vector (CSV) analysis onto a tropical intermediate coupled model. Emphasis places on identifying the optimal perturbation that can result in the fastest prediction error growth of the EIO SSTA. It is found that, with the 6\u2010month lead prediction, the spatial pattern of the optimal initial perturbations is characterized by a negative SSTA pole with the diverged surface wind in the southern Indian Ocean and a positive SSTA pole with the converged surface wind in the eastern Pacific. The growth rate of optimal initial perturbation, as measured by the leading singular value, exhibits significant interannual variation consistent with the variation of the SSTA in EIO. Specifically, when the SSTA in the EIO is colder, the prediction error grows more rapidly, and conversely, when the SSTA is warmer, the error grows more slowly. The results of the dynamical analysis show that a cold SSTA background strengthens Ekman feedback through both atmospheric and oceanic responses, leading to faster growth of prediction errors. This study enhances our understanding to the predictability in the Indian Ocean, in particular the role of EIO in the Indian Ocean dipole predictability."

    "content": "Abstract\nSatellite\u2010derived sea ice products and ice model simulations are analyzed in the Bering Sea during the winters of 2018\u20132019, featuring historically low sea ice coverage on the Eastern Bering Sea shelf, and 2019\u20132020, when ice conditions were close to average. Hindcast simulations are conducted using the Community sea Ice CodE (CICE) as a standalone regional ice model forced with ERA5 atmospheric fields and oceanic fields derived from realizations of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) internally coupled with its own ice model component. CICE is able to predict the observed seasonal variability in ice concentration and ice thickness provided that ocean mixed layer temperature and salinity are strongly nudged toward an accurate ocean state. Ice mass balance analysis shows that sustained periods of southerly wind during the 2018\u201319 season led to increased melting and a larger ice export into the Arctic when compared to 2019\u201320. More ice was produced in 2018\u201319, the season with lower sea ice areal extent, offset by larger melting and transport out of the domain. The volume of ice exported to the Russian shelf and basin is comparable to the net transport through the Bering Strait. The consistency between the model and satellite products demonstrates that the representation of sea ice thermodynamic and dynamic models present in CICE are adequate for representing key physical processes driving sea ice variability in this region during both low and normal ice coverage years."

    "content": "Abstract\nInternal waves and geostrophic motions contribute to sea surface height (SSH) variability at scales order 100\u00a0km and smaller. Although geostrophic motions have a well\u2010defined contribution in SSH, the internal wave contribution is complex and small enough to be confounded with noise. This has impeded attempts to separate internal wave effects from geostrophic signals in SSH measurements. Shipboard acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) data combined with along\u2010track satellite altimetry are used to estimate the internal\u2010wave component of the SSH wavenumber spectrum in the southeast tropical Pacific. A modified wave\u2010vortex kinetic energy (KE) decomposition in combination with linear wave theory and the Garrett\u2010Munk model are used to convert the ADCP\u2010inferred wave KE spectrum into an SSH spectrum representative of the wave continuum. The continuum component explains the SSH spectral slope (\u223c\u22122) $(\\sim -2)$ of this area. The full SSH spectrum is reconstructed as the sum of the contributions from the internal wave continuum, the geostrophically balanced (\u201cvortex\u201d) component, internal tides, and altimeter noise. The SSH spectra of internal tides and altimeter noise are derived from models. The reconstruction recovers 80% of the observed variance at large scales and 60% within the semidiurnal internal tide band. The residual between this reconstruction and the altimetry\u2010derived spectrum is interpreted as nonstationary internal tidal energy. The nonstationary tide is more energetic than suggested by previous altimeter\u2010based estimates, highlighting the challenge of extracting geostrophic signals from SSH."

Yet, the fine\u2010scale structure, variability, and long\u2010term evolution of its water masses and nutrient concentrations remain poorly characterized. Here, we combine almost two decades of high\u2010resolution hydrographic and biogeochemical data (2006\u20132024) to resolve the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient availability and water mass (WM) properties across this key arctic gateway. Using unsupervised clustering and tracer\u2010based diagnostics, we identify three dominant WM regimes shaped by Arctic and Atlantic influences, glacial inputs, and internal mixing. Our analysis reveals net freshening and nutrient shifts across all major water masses, including a doubling of nutrient concentrations in the arctic upper halocline as well as significant freshening of Polar Mode Water and Baffin Bay Polar Water properties. This multidecadal analysis provides crucial insights into the complex drivers of hydrographic and nutrient changes, enhancing our ability to predict how Arctic productivity will evolve."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe lucinid clam Lucinoma capensis thrives at the oxygen minimum zone margins in the Benguela Upwelling System, where oxygen levels fluctuate dramatically. Understanding its adaptation to such extreme conditions provides key insights into survival strategies under fluctuating oxygen availability. We investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of L. capensis under normoxia, hypoxia, and recovery, focusing on the gills and digestive gland. Our findings highlight distinct organ\u2010specific responses, with the gills showing strong transcriptional changes to oxygen fluctuations, in contrast to the more stable profile observed in the digestive gland. Under hypoxic conditions, the gills exhibited coordinated downregulation of protein synthesis, transposable element activity, and immune function, suggesting a tightly regulated energy conservation strategy and mechanisms to preserve symbiont stability and genomic integrity. Activation of prokaryotic metabolism in the gills supports the symbionts' role in host energy acquisition and sulfide detoxification during hypoxia. In contrast, the digestive gland showed minimal transcriptional shifts during anoxia, with upregulation of pathways supporting structural maintenance. Upon reoxygenation, the gills displayed an active and asymmetric recovery, characterised by rapid restoration of protein synthesis and gradual normalisation of protein degradation and immune functions. Despite significant transcriptomic changes, the metabolome remained largely stable, reflecting L. capensis's resilience to oxygen fluctuations. However, an overshoot in TCA cycle intermediates and derepression of previously downregulated pathways indicate that reoxygenation involves active metabolic reprogramming, not merely a return to baseline. This study highlights the specialised tissue responses and symbiotic contributions that enable L. capensis to thrive in one of the ocean's most challenging environments."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nThe marine environment comprises vast regions without physical barriers to movement, making the understanding of population isolation and the evolution of diversity challenging. This is especially the case for highly mobile marine species. Here we investigate populations of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) across the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic using high\u2010resolution genomic markers (RADseq) and stable isotope analyses to better understand the evolution of population structure in this system. High\u2010resolution genomic data and broad geographic sampling revealed patterns of structure not previously identified, and integration with stable isotope data suggests that prey choice varies across this region. Unexpected patterns included genetic and isotopic similarity between the North Atlantic and the region around Sicily (but not including the medially located Gulf of C\u00e1diz and surrounding regions). The regional habitat within and beyond the Mediterranean Sea is structured with ocean frontal systems including thermal and halocline transitions, several of which show alignment with genetic transitions within our data. Our data help to distinguish among possible drivers of population differentiation for a marine predator that has the potential for long\u2010distance dispersion."

    "content": "ABSTRACT\nPast population dynamics during the Pleistocene ice age and the Holocene era have profoundly influenced the genetic structure and diversity of species. Environmental heterogeneity has further shaped local and regional adaptive variation. Here, we ask how historical processes have led to the current genetic diversity of a key North American species across its vast natural range and what genomic signatures indicate regional adaptive divergence and local adaptation. We used sequencing data from 1903 Populus tremuloides Michx. (quaking aspen) trees to assess historical population dynamics and identify genotype \u2013environment associations within and among the species' major genetic lineages. The two northern and western North American aspen lineages exhibited historical population expansion patterns, while the southernmost lineage experienced a historical bottleneck consistent with past glacial oscillations. We found that the earliest split between genetic lineages of P. tremuloides occurred in the southern part of its distribution range. We further identified larger blocks of adaptive SNPs within separate genomic sequence regions on chromosomes 2 and 8 that may exhibit suppressed genetic recombination, contributing to the maintenance of regional and local adaptation in the species. Our study provides key insights into the evolutionary processes affecting adaptive genetic variation and phylogeography at a broad continental and regional scale, with implications for predicting species' responses to future climate change."

Unfortunately, the number of sustainable practices needed to support production, ecosystem services and land conservation remains virtually unknown. We compiled a database of 1570 observations from 349 sites in 57 countries to assess how the number of sustainable practices influences multiple ecosystem services. Our findings reveal that a high number of sustainable practices is crucial for enhancing agroecosystem services such as soil carbon storage, fertility and microbial habitat while supporting yield. Sustainable practices such as crop rotation, limited tillage and incorporation of crop residues were especially important. North America, Eastern Europe and China were particularly dependent on the use of multiple sustainable practices to maintain ecosystem services. Findings underscore the need for integrative strategies employing multiple sustainable practices for mitigating global change, ensuring food security and sustaining ecosystems."

    "content": "<p>by Xitong Luo, Lei Zhang, Yafeng Pan</p>\n\nWe often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence\u2014from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence\u2014has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human communications. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees\u2019 opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees\u2019 opinions (Studies 1 & 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 & 4). Our findings reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees\u2019 opinions (we refer to this as the <i>alignment bias</i>) (Study 1). This tendency, which reflects normative conformity, persists even when advisors were directly incentivized to provide accurate advice (Study 2). As feedback is introduced, advisors\u2019 behavior shifts in ways best captured by a reinforcement learning model, suggesting that advisees\u2019 feedback drives adaptations in advice giving that maximize acceptance and minimize rejection (Study 3). This adaptation persisted even when acceptance is rare, as bolstered by the model-based evidence (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors\u2019 susceptibility to the consequence of giving advice, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters."

Here, we report the role of microtubule (MT) nanotubes in rendering the <i>Drosophila</i> micropyle functional, a structure essential for sperm entry during fertilization. Our study highlights that MT-nanotubes emanate from the apical end of the specialized epithelial cells called the polar cells in late oogenesis, forming a narrow channel through the eggshell. Utilizing a combination of fly genetics, live cell imaging, and tissue immunochemistry, our research elucidates the structural and functional characteristics of the polar cell nanotube. We show that tubulin is vital for the formation of these nanotubes, which are enriched in the lateral membrane marker, Fasciclin III. Moreover, the overall polarity of the migrating cell cluster is critical for the successful development of the micropyle. Notably, both lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking within the polar cells are essential for the opening of the vitelline layer, further facilitating the micropyle\u2019s role in fertilization."

Here we found that Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), a neuron-specific protein in the brain, played an important role in dictating synaptic NMDAR subunit composition in spinal cord somatostatin-positive (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neuron, a key component in the spinal circuit transmitting mechanical pain in mice. Our data showed that the protein level of RIN1 was low early after birth, which progressively increased with synapse maturation and promoted the switch from synaptic GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs. In adult mice, the nerve injury-induced pathological pain paralleled a significant increase of RIN1 protein in spinal SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons, which drove a new round of GluN2B-to-GluN2A switching at mature synapses. Our data revealed the molecular mechanisms by which RIN1 differentially regulated the synaptic trafficking of GluN2B and GluN2A receptors, and implied that RIN1-mediated pathological switch of NMDAR subunit composition strikingly altered the analgesic efficacy of distinct NMDAR subunit antagonists with the development of neuropathic pain."

Here, we show that supplementation of multiple low-dose nutrients\u2014an important environmental factor contributing to ASD\u2014can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in mice. First, we used <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, a well-established model of ASD, to investigate the effect of nutrient cocktails containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine, all of which are known to regulate synapse formation and activity. Supplementation of nutrient cocktails for 7 days altered total proteomes by increasing synapse-related proteins. Our results further reveal that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Nutrient supplementation normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA neurons in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement mixtures containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in <i>Nf1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> and <i>Cttnbp2</i><sup>+/M120I</sup> mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models."

    "content": "Abstract\nVolatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)\u2014carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and carbon disulfide (CS2)\u2014play critical roles in atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, quantitative understanding of VSC exchange dynamics in coastal wetland ecosystems remains limited. Here, we quantified the sediment\u2010air fluxes of these VSCs across vegetated (Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda glauca) and unvegetated mudflat habitats via year\u2010round field observations in a temperate intertidal wetland. We found that S. alterniflora sediments exhibited net emissions of COS (4.61\u2009\u00b1\u20099.19\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), DMS (10.25\u2009\u00b1\u200912.35\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), and CS2 (5.77\u2009\u00b1\u20097.29\u2009nmol\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121), while S. glauca and mudflats exhibited variable sink\u2013source dynamics. VSC fluxes from S. alterniflora habitats significantly exceeded those from other zones due to high root sulfate and total sulfur contents, as well as microbial organisms and temperature\u2010dependent microbial activity related to sulfur metabolism. The DMS flux in S. alterniflora zones decreased by 33\u2013224% after ebb tide compared to before flooding, with principal component analysis identifying phase\u2010specific controls: pre\u2010flood fluxes were associated with porewater chemistry (pH, redox potential) and atmosphere (water content, pressure) coupling, while post\u2010ebb fluxes were governed by ionic gradients (conductivity) and residual moisture (water content). Tidal simulation experiments revealed the joint influences of illumination, water content, and anaerobic processes on VSC production, where anaerobic conditions suppressed DMS and CS2 formation but enhanced COS emission in the dark. These findings establish that coastal VSC fluxes are regulated by the interplay between macrophyte\u2010mediated sediment biogeochemistry and tidal pumping. This provides mechanistic insights into wetland sulfur cycle modeling."

    "content": "Mechanistic models are central to quantitative understanding and optimisation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture processes, but their utility is often restricted by parameter sets calibrated for specific cell lines, scales, or operating conditions. In this study, we present the application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to bioprocessing, introducing an ensemble-based framework for dual state and parameter estimation that enables mechanistic model adaptation across distinct systems. The EnKF recursively assimilates process measurements to update uncertain kinetic parameters and predict system states, allowing a model developed for one system to be transferred to a new one without reparametrisation and using only a single experimental dataset. The evolving parameter ensembles provide a time-resolved sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters have dominant influence under new process conditions and when their effects become significant. The framework was evaluated across six CHO cell experimental datasets differing in scale, cell line, temperature, and feeding strategy, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of system dynamics and progressive improvement in long-term predictions as new data became available. By maintaining full mechanistic transparency while flexibly adapting to new data, the EnKF offers a practical route for knowledge transfer across systems, strengthening the role of mechanistic modelling in data-informed bioprocess understanding and control."

    "content": "Tumor growth and resistance arise from the interplay between cell-cycle dysregulation and the spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). While spatial transcriptomics now enables molecular profiling of intact tissues, it captures only static molecular states, making it challenging to reconstruct dynamic processes such as proliferation. Here, we develop SpaceCycle, a computational framework that infers the continuous cell-cycle phase and associated oscillatory gene expression dynamics from spatial transcriptomic data. Using human melanoma, breast, and lung tumors, we map both discrete and continuous cell-cycle states across entire tissue sections to reveal how proliferative activity is spatially structured within the TME. We find that cycling and non-cycling cells form distinct spatial niches reflecting differences in vascularization, immune composition, and cellular density. Continuous-phase inference further exposes tumor-specific variations in cell cycle phase durations and uncovers oscillatory programs. Together, our results provide a spatiotemporal view of cell-cycle organization in human tumors and establish a general framework for detecting dynamic transcriptional programs and spatial proliferation patterns from static tissue data."

    "content": "Fine-tuned regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity is essential for accurate gene expression. A key layer of this regulation involves phosphorylation of Pol II's C-terminal domain (CTD), a repetitive heptapeptide tail that coordinates transcription and RNA-processing factors. The kinase P-TEFb plays a major role in this process, yet its precise phosphorylation mechanism remains unclear. Previous in vitro studies have suggested a distributive mode of action based largely on qualitative inspection of mass spectrometry data rather than quantitative analysis. Here, we use mathematical modeling of CTD phosphorylation to explore whether local context, such as neighboring phosphorylations or directional biases, affects P-TEFb activity on the CTD. Our results indicate that P-TEFb acts distributively but with pronounced local cooperativity: repeats adjacent to phosphorylated sites are modified at higher rates. We find no evidence for directional bias, although the limited positional resolution of the data precludes a definitive conclusion. These results identify local context as an important factor in P-TEFb-mediated CTD phosphorylation and establish a quantitative modeling framework for dissecting multi-site modification dynamics."

    "content": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) arises from coupled interactions between blood flow, tissue mechanics, and cellular signaling. Hemodynamic forces influence endothelial and interstitial cell behavior, while the resulting tissue remodeling alters valve motion and flow patterns. Capturing this two-way feedback requires models that integrate fluid-structure mechanics with biochemical regulation, yet such multiscale coupling remains technically challenging. Previous computational models have focused on isolated aspects of the disease: fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations reproduce valve deformation and flow, and systems biology (SB) models describe molecular signaling that drives fibrosis and calcification. However, without coupling, these approaches cannot predict how mechanical dysfunction initiates biochemical remodeling or how biochemical changes feed back on mechanics. Here, we present a multi-physics computational framework that couples three-dimensional FSI simulations of aortic valve dynamics with a mechanistic SB model of calcification signaling. The FSI module resolves pulsatile blood flow and leaflet deformation, yielding local wall shear stresses and tissue strains throughout the cardiac cycle. These mechanical quantities are used as inputs to the SB module, which represents key biochemical pathways governing inflammation, TGF-{beta}/SMAD signaling, and nitric-oxide (NO)--mediated inhibition within valvular cells. Simulations predict long-term calcification trajectories for valves of varying thickness, showing that fibrosis-induced stiffening lowers shear stress, reduces NO synthesis, and enhances TGF-{beta} activation, thereby accelerating calcification. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing future incorporation of additional pathways, as well as implementation of full two-way coupling between the FSI and SB models. By integrating physics-based hemodynamics with systems-level biochemistry, this study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a next-generation, multi-scale modeling platform for studying cardiovascular disease that unites blood flow dynamics and biochemical signaling."

To address the challenge of high-throughput screening in filamentous fungi, we developed methods to construct a genome-wide barcoded insertional mutant library in Trichoderma atroviride, a filamentous fungus widely used as a biocontrol agent against bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. Our strategy leveraged randomly barcoded transfer DNA insertions from plasmid libraries containing hundreds of millions of unique DNA barcodes and a broad host-range drug resistance marker delivered via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into T. atroviride. By optimizing transformation conditions, we achieved up to 600 independent transformants per infection event, resulting in a library of over 31,000 mapped insertions disrupting 7,115 of the 11,828 predicted genes in the T. atroviride genome. This resource establishes a scalable platform for high-throughput functional genomics in filamentous fungi, enabling both fundamental investigations of fungal biology and engineering approaches toward improved medical applications, biotechnology, and sustainable agriculture."

    "content": "Classical microbiology has focused on directly suppressing pathogens using drugs, ignoring other harmless microbial species living alongside the pathogens. We now have a much better understanding of how species interact and affect one another's growth within microbial communities, for example through chemical production. Here we capitalize on this understanding to demonstrate how one can manipulate and control the strength of interactions between bacterial species, and combine this with antibiotics to fully suppress and eliminate pathogens. Using experiments and a mathematical model, we first show how Citrobacter freundii can reduce the environmental pH to enhance the effect of ampicillin on the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This negative interaction from C. freundii to P. aeruginosa can be strengthened by increasing glucose concentrations. Our proof-of-concept approach also worked against other pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a different commensal: Lactobacillus plantarum, a common probiotic species. Overall, we show that taking advantage of the community and chemical context in which microbes live can help to develop efficient strategies to control them. In the medical context, this approach can help to eliminate pathogens thereby reducing our reliance on antibiotics."

    "content": "Crawling motility is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells and requires a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, regulated adhesion, and spatially organized signalling pathways. Asgard archaea (phylum Promethearchaeota) which are considered the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes potentially encode these functions within their large set of eukaryotic signature proteins. The few cultivated members show a complex cell morphology, consisting of a central cell body from which several protrusions extend, filled with an actin-based cytoskeleton. Here, live cell microscopy of two organisms of the Loki- and Hodarchaea lineages showed that they dynamically and drastically change their cell shape on a minute time scale and grow and retract their extensive protrusions with a speed of 1.5 to 5.3 micron/min, respectively. After adhering to a glass surface, cells employ their protrusions to undergo active crawling motion. In the presence of selected actin inhibitors however, the observed dynamics were arrested, suggesting a central role of actin in these processes. The observed cellular plasticity and motility are unique features among prokaryotes and might have been crucial for the emergence of the first eukaryotic cells that are thought to have formed through the association of a member of the Promethearchaeota and an alphaproteobacterium, the ancestor of mitochondria."

We report that Plectosphaerella cucumerina is a core member of the Arabidopsis thaliana root microbiota displaying high pathogenic potential and multi-host colonization capabilities. Establishment of a Plectosphaerella reference culture collection, followed by whole-genome sequencing of 72 strains reveals subtle phenotypic and genotypic variation that associate with fungal phylogeny, but not host plant identity. Transcriptome profiling of a model P. cucumerina isolate in roots of multiple hosts identifies core and host-specific fungal processes linked to carbon catabolism and root cell wall deconstruction of the hosts. A fungal gene encoding a candidate Beta-1,3-glucanase (GH64) was identified as a key genetic factor driving infection and disease in plants that diverged 110 million years ago. The gene is enriched in plant-colonizing fungi and consistently functions as a disease determinant in the root pathogen Colletotrichum incanum. We conclude that diverse and tunable fungal repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes act as disease determinants and drive multi-host compatibility belowground."

    "content": "Despite microorganisms being primarily responsible for landfill material decomposition, limited characterization has been performed across both landfill depth and age. Here, we investigated the microbial communities and physicochemical parameters in two active and two closed landfill wells from surface to bottom, as well as fill dirt and leachate at a sanitary landfill near Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Amplicon community sequencing fungi, bacteria and archaea revealed distinct microbial community structures across landfill sites. The observed patterns of microbial community succession by depth and age mirror the known phases of the landfill life cycle. Younger surface samples were dominated by aerobic fungi, which transitioned to fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in older, deeper, layers. Simultaneously, high species richness was preserved across landfill ages, while reduced evenness at specific depths support spatial niche differentiation. In conjunction with the lack of trends found for physicochemical parameters by depth, this supports niche differentiation driven by the highly heterogenous waste inputs. This study provides the first comprehensive vertical profile of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across landfill depths and ages, highlighting the influence of these parameters on physicochemical factors and microbial distribution within landfills. These results have implications for improving landfill management, including renewable gas energy production, minimizing emissions, and increasing degradation rates."

    "content": "Picocyanobacteria from the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus thrive across the globe in aqueous environments, have relatively small genomes, and have growth dynamics regulated by both viral interactions and abiotic conditions, making them excellent model organisms for exploring host-pathogen coevolution. The Salish Sea, located in the Western coastal waters bordering the USA and Canada, is at the current northern boundary (defined by Prochlorococcus versus Synechococcus prevalence ratios) of the range of Prochlorococcus. Predictions suggest that this boundary will shift as warmer waters move northward, providing an excellent system to study host-pathogen dynamics and coevolution in a changing environmental context. In preparation for such studies, we developed and refined methods to sample and sequence cyanobacteria, cyanophages, and their abiotic environment. In addition to basic methodological questions focused on the physical sampling, filtering, viral precipitation, DNA extraction, and technical replicability, we explored how well our filtering and extraction protocols enrich for our main target, picocyanobacteria. The protocol described herein can successfully discriminate large-cell eukaryotic organisms, but size fractionation of picocyanobacteria appears to be affected by the presence of free DNA, multicellular structures, and abundant tycheposons. Our preferred final protocol at the conclusion of these experiments based on yield and processing time is presented. We recovered substantial Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and amoeba-like sequences in most samples, and preliminary exploration of relative taxon sequence read recoveries across locations, over time, and tidal conditions are also discussed. Approaches described here may be useful to other efforts such as harmful algal bloom monitoring, species isolation and enrichment, water quality assessments, anti-viral discovery, and understanding picocyanobacterial population changes over space and time."

    "content": "Orientia tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the mite-borne human disease scrub typhus. The species is characterised by having many strains that differ in their ability to cause disease in murine infection models and in human patients. The genomes of a diverse set of Orientia tsutsugamushi strains have recently been analysed in detail, revealing broadly similar gene content with genomes differing primarily in synteny and in the composition of a large arsenal of predicted secreted effector proteins. Given the similarity in gene content, here we asked whether the observed differences in virulence were driven by genome-wide differences in gene expression of bacterial genes, and differences in the ensuing response of infected host cells. To explore this, we carried out a dual RNA sequencing analysis of eight diverse strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi grown in cultured human endothelial cells. An overall analysis found no clear patterns in the bacterial or host gene expression patterns that correlate with the ability to cause disease. We found that all strains induce a strong type 1 interferon response in endothelial cells, but that within that broad response each strain has a unique fingerprint of induced genes likely leading to different disease outcomes when combined with a complex immune system in vivo. We compared expression levels of orthologous genes between different strains and identified some bacterial pathways with constant expression levels whilst others were more variable, leading to the identification of specific pathways under tight transcriptional control during cellular infection. Together our data show that inter-strain differences in virulence are not defined by expression levels of any one set of bacterial or host genes and also reveal insights into transcriptional regulation of different pathways in Orientia tsutsugamushi."

    "content": "Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-originspecific epigenetic mechanism with essential roles in placental development and fetal growth in mice, but its contribution to brain function and evolution remains unclear. Here, we investigated genomic imprinting in the ferret, a gyrencephalic mammal whose cortical architecture closely resembles that of humans rather than mice. Guided by human imprinting datasets, we screened 65 candidate genes in ferret brain and identified paternal expression of Adam23, maternal expression of Atp10a, and biallelic expression of genes including PXDC1, WRB and UBE3A. Adam23 showed paternal expression in ferret cortex, particularly in the occipital region, whereas it was biallelically expressed in mouse brain. In human SH-SY5Y cells, Adam23 was biallelic in undifferentiated cells but shifted toward monoallelic expression upon neuronal differentiation. CpG analysis of upstream islands indicated that Adam23 imprinting in ferrets is independent of promoter methylation, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism. Functional assays in Neuro-2aTG cells showed that Adam23 knockdown enhances neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression promotes cell proliferation. These findings identify Adam23 as a non-canonical imprinted gene whose dosage influences stem cell dynamics and neurite development, linking imprinting to the evolution of gyrencephalic cortical structures and highlighting the ferret as a valuable model for imprinting studies in higher-order brain function."

    "content": "The multidrug resistance (MDR) problem in Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is becoming increasingly severe, necessitating the development of novel antibacterial agents and strategies. In this study, seven Elaiophylin derivatives were isolated from Streptomyces sp. WS-30248, and the antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of the principal compound, Elaiophylin, against S. suis were systematically evaluated for the first time. Through comprehensive approaches including in vitro efficacy assays, biofilm inhibition and eradication tests, bacterial membrane integrity analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level detection, and a mouse infection model, Elaiophylin was found to exhibit significant antibacterial activity against multiple clinically MDR S. suis strains. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 0.5 g/mL, and complete bactericidal activity was achieved within 24 hours at 4xMIC. The compound effectively inhibited and eradicated bacterial biofilms, directly killing embedded cells within the biofilm matrix. Mechanistic studies revealed that Elaiophylin functions through multiple synergistic pathways, including disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and induction of massive ROS accumulation, thereby interfering with the proton motive force (PMF), depleting intracellular ATP, and blocking energy metabolism. In the mouse infection model, the Elaiophylin-treated group showed a significantly increased survival rate of 60% and effectively reduced bacterial loads in tissues. This study demonstrates that Elaiophylin is a highly promising natural candidate drug with multi-target synergistic effects, offering a new strategy to combat MDR S. suis and biofilm-associated infections."

We show in this study that Aer also senses oxidative stress and performs FAD-dependent negative chemotaxis in response to the known ROS H2O2. The ability of Aer to detect both oxidizing and reducing intracellular environments redefines its functional range and establishes Aer as a bidirectional redox sensor. We show in addition that the ability of bacterial swarms to move away from bactericidal antibiotics is Aer-dependent and is abolished by expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG, which scavenges intracellular ROS. Our study thus provides independent behavioral evidence that certain antibiotics generate intracellular ROS, while also offering a sensitive assay for detecting these reactive species."

    "content": "Intracellular bacterial symbioses have arisen myriad times in eukaryotes, with dozens known from insects alone. Beginning with Buchnera, the obligate endosymbiont of aphids, genomes of endosymbionts have illuminated their evolutionary origins and metabolic contributions to hosts. However, the mechanisms by which nonculturable endosymbionts enter host cells and suppress cellular immune processes have remained unknown. We show that an uncharacterized Buchnera protein, here designated SyeA, was present in the Buchnera ancestor, is secreted and homologous to secreted effectors of bacterial pathogens and is essential for Buchnera transmission. Buchnera is transmitted via expulsion from specialized maternal cells and uptake by embryos. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that SyeA levels peak upon colonization, accompanied by actin accumulation at the entry site. SyeA localizes outside the host-derived membrane and actin layer surrounding each Buchnera cell and colocalizes in host cytoplasm with Rho1, which regulates actin polymerization. syeA knockdown disrupts colonization and embryonic development and elevates lysosomal activity, leading to Buchnera destruction6. Our findings provide rare insight into how an anciently associated, mutualistic endosymbiont achieves its intracellular existence. SyeA is a vestige of pathogenic origins followed by evolution of increased host control and erosion of the original, more complex pathogenicity machinery."

Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of 191 wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from six populations from Alaskan lakes spanning a gradient of surface area. We tested how environmental context (lake size and ecotype) and host traits (sex, body mass, gravidity, Schistocephalus solidus (S. solidus) infection, and fibrosis) influence stickleback gut microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the lake surface area strongly predicted fish gut microbial alpha diversity. Fish from intermediate-sized lakes harbored significantly more diverse microbiota than those from small and large lakes, independent of ecotype. Body mass was associated with gut microbial diversity. Model-predicted marginal effects from the mass and lake surface area interaction analysis showed that the association between fish mass and microbial alpha diversity was strongly negative in the smallest lakes, weakest in intermediate-sized lakes, and strongly positive in the largest lakes. In addition, sex and S. solidus infection were significantly associated with gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity, whereas fibrosis and gravidity showed minimal effects. Differential abundance analysis revealed lake size-dependent associations between body mass and individual taxa. Together, these results demonstrate that both habitat context and host variation interactively shape stickleback gut microbial communities in the wild. Integrating lake-level and individual-level analyses reveals how ecological setting modulates host-microbe associations, offering insights into the role of the gut microbiota in host adaptation and population divergence."

In Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/Y/Z assembly associates with and translocates across the nucleoid in a PomZ ATPase-dependent manner to position the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring at midcell. Unlike other systems incorporating a ParA/MinD ATPase, the PomX/Y/Z system incorporates two ATPase Activating Proteins (AAPs), PomX and PomY, that stimulate PomZ activity. While PomX AAP activity, similarly to other characterized AAPs of ParA/MinD ATPases, resides in a short positively charged N-terminal peptide (PomXNPEP), the mechanism of PomY-mediated activation of PomZ remained unknown. We map PomY AAP activity to its C-terminal residues 496-682 (PomY496-682) and show that this activity is important for division site positioning and the initiation of cell division. Structural modeling suggests a bipartite PomY496-682 architecture, comprising a globular domain and an intrinsically disordered region containing the short 5 helix. However, modeling supported an interaction only between 5 and the PomZ dimer. The 5 binding site partially overlaps with that of the prototype AAP ParB on the ParA dimer but 5 lacks a positively charged residue critical for ParB AAP activity. Modeling supported that PomXNPEP binds the PomZ dimer at a site distinct from that of 5 and which overlaps with that of the prototype AAP MinE on the MinD dimer. These findings reveal a non-canonical AAP mechanism of PomY, while PomXNPEP likely functions analogously to MinE, indicating that PomX and PomY act in concert through distinct but complementary mechanisms to stimulate PomZ ATPase activity, thereby efficiently driving the positioning of the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring."

    "content": "Multiple enteroviruses are associated with life-threatening and economically important diseases, yet licensed vaccines are available only against poliovirus (worldwide) and enterovirus A71 (China). Both live attenuated and inactivated anti-poliovirus vaccines, while highly successful in preventing the disease, have important shortcomings. Live vaccine strains are inherently genetically unstable and can regain virulence, leading to re-emergence of paralytic disease. Inactivated vaccine does not induce the mucosal immunity sufficient to interrupt viral transmission and is made from virulent strains, presenting a biosafety challenge. Recent alternatives, such as new vaccine strains with improved genetic stability and VLP-based vaccines, only partially address these concerns. Here, we investigated another approach to the development of anti-enterovirus vaccines based on efficient trans-encaspidation of replication-competent enterovirus RNAs coding for only the non-structural proteins (replicons) by Newcastle Disease virus vectors expressing enterovirus capsid proteins. Thus, the encapsidated replicon production is driven by effectively replicating enterovirus RNA and the NDV vector. This system is easily scalable and can be adapted to any cell culture provided it can be infected by both the enterovirus and NDV. Unlike the empty VLPs, the encapsidated replicons recapitulate the stability and antigenicity of native enterovirus particles, but cannot propagate beyond the originally infected cell. The protective efficacy of an encapsidated poliovirus replicon immunization was similar to that of the licensed Sabin vaccine strain in a murine model. This approach can easily be adapted to any enterovirus, allowing the rapid development of new, affordable vaccine candidates."

    "content": "Archaea of the order Sulfolobales possess eukaryotic-like cell cycle. The chromatin organization in these archaea is supposed to rely on nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Genomes of Sulfolobales species encode multiple members of the Lrs14 protein family, which have been postulated to function as NAPs. Here, we show that one of the Lrs14 family protein, named Sul14a, is a potential key player in dynamic chromatin organization in Saccharolobus islandicus. Sul14a is transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and appears to be essential for cell viability. The protein exhibits DNA-binding activity preferring AT-rich sequences and can bridge DNA in vitro. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Sul14a is enriched at AT-rich regions of the chromatin. Overexpression of Sul14a leads to cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and transcriptomic analyses indicate that Sul14a overexpression results in chromatin contact reduction and global transcriptional changes. In addition, we observed that the chromatin contact pattern changes markedly between 1h and 5h after release from G2 synchronization, corresponding to the lowest and highest levels of sul14a transcription, respectively, during the cell cycle. Our results establish that Sul14a is an NAP intimately associated with chromatin dynamics and global transcriptional changes during the cell cycle in Sulfolobales."

    "content": "The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis has sparked renewed interest in using bacteriophage (phage) as a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Phage are viruses that infect and often kill bacteria, and have served as key models for many molecular biology studies. There are many complex phage-bacterial interactions that dictate the success or failure of the phage life cycle, but many of these are not well understood or characterised. These include the specific interactions to recognize a bacterium during the infection process, bacterial phage defence mechanisms and metabolic pathways that are key to phage replication. In this study a novel Escherichia coli phage, Arnold, is characterised and the genome sequence is reported. We then use transposon-directed insertion sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of E. coli mutants to identify over 200 genes involved in Arnold phage infection or in phage resistance. Using this approach, we identified both an outer membrane protein (BtuB, vitamin B12 transporter) and an inner membrane protein (SdaC, serine/proton symporter) involved in phage infection. Deletions in these genes were shown to provide immunity to infection by this phage. Understanding the genetic basis of phage infection and phage resistance should allow us to select or design phage to target specific bacterial pathogens in the future."

    "content": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum depends entirely on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, as it is unable to salvage these essential nucleotides. This reliance makes the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway a compelling target for antimalarial drugs, with several inhibitors targeting its rate-limiting enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), already in clinical development. In this study, we investigated the roles of three other pathway enzymes - aspartate transcarbamoylase (PfATC), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (PfCPSII), and dihydroorotase (PfDHO). PfATC features a unique N-terminal extension predicted to serve as an apicoplast trafficking peptide. However, using antibodies against the native protein and an epitope-tagged version, we found no evidence of apicoplast localization. Knockdown of PfATC expression proved lethal and could not be rescued by an apicoplast metabolic bypass. Complementation assays further revealed that truncation of the N-terminal domain impaired parasite growth, suggesting that this region is important for PfATC function or stability in vivo. PfCPSII, which harbors large Plasmodium-specific insertions between its catalytic domains, was likewise found to be essential for parasite proliferation. To assess the role of PfDHO, we engineered parasites to salvage uracil via heterologous expression of a yeast enzyme. Deletion of PfDHO in this parasite line resulted in uracil auxotrophy, confirming the enzyme's essential function in pyrimidine synthesis. Together, these findings reveal multiple vulnerable nodes within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway."

    "content": "When bacteriophages infect starved host bacteria, the restrictive host physiology may lead to prolonged latent periods and/or reduced burst sizes, compared to infection of a fast-growing bacterium. Using a mathematical model, we explore a system of two types of virulent phages that have distinct host physiology dependencies and are infecting a shared bacterial host population. We consider different environmental regimes to test whether they can compete and coexist under fluctuating conditions, putting emphasis on phases with limited resources for bacterial growth. We find that phages capable of delaying lysis in response to nutrient limitations can outcompete fast-replicating phages in feast-famine environments. This advantage mainly stems from increased mortality of free phages due to abortive adsorption to already infected hosts during starvation phases. We identify specific system dynamics that either support or suppress the propagation of the delayed lysis phage. This theoretical analysis highlights the competitive benefits and the limitations of delayed lysis as a phage propagation strategy. Our results underscore importance of considering the bacterial physiology dependence of bacteriophage replication in order to correctly predict phage fitness and population dynamics in complex environments."

    "content": "Microbial sulfate reduction is a cornerstone of marine sediment biogeochemistry, driving carbon remineralization and fueling the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Yet in zones of high methane flux, sulfate limitations may constrain the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that typically perform AOM. Although often overlooked, sulfur redox intermediates are readily utilized by diverse microorganisms, potentially driving AOM in sulfate-limited zones. To resolve the microbial mechanisms underlying cryptic sulfur cycling in such sediments, Monterey Canyon cold methane seeps were investigated through an integrated geochemical, isotopic, and metatranscriptomic approach. High-resolution electrochemical measurements confirmed intense sulfide production in seep sites, and long-term anoxic incubations were conducted with sediment from the SMTZ amended with elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or sulfate as the sole sulfur source, with or without methane. Over 650 days, sulfide accumulation was greatest in elemental sulfur treatments, followed by thiosulfate and sulfate; in all cases methane addition enhanced sulfide production. Isotopic measurements showed modest S-isotope fractionation indicating that the large fractionations typical of slow sulfate reduction were muted by additional sulfur transformations. In elemental sulfur treatments, isotopic and geochemical patterns suggested that disproportionation was unlikely. Metatranscriptomes revealed broad expression of sox genes and abundant dsr/apr across treatments, along with thiosulfate-linked phs upregulation. While ANME-2c and SEEP-SRB2 activity increased with methane, transcriptomic and isotopic data together highlighted the roles of Desulfocapsaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Sulfurovaceae lineages in mediating sulfur transformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate how cryptic sulfur cycling may sustain microbial communities in sulfate-depleted deep-sea sediments and contribute to AOM."

ALAN increased M. aquaticum height and total biomass, but had no effect on native species growth. In feeding assays, P. canaliculata consumed all three native species but consistently avoided M. aquaticum under both light treatments. C. chinensis showed no feeding in no-choice assays, but in choice assays, consumed H. verticillata and M. spicatum under No-ALAN and only M. spicatum under ALAN. In community mesocosms, P. canaliculata reduced native macrophyte biomass by 48.0% under No-ALAN and 87.2% under ALAN without affecting M. aquaticum. This selective feeding increased M. aquaticum's proportional biomass, with a stronger effect under ALAN than No-ALAN. These results suggest that ALAN can indirectly facilitate non-native macrophyte invasion by amplifying their relative biomass within native communities, particularly in the presence of invasive herbivores, and may promote invasional meltdown through altered feeding preferences."

Peterson & Saarela (synonym Spartina anglica) is a highly invasive coastal weed that forms dense monocultures in intertidal mudflats and estuaries, displacing native reedbeds and associated fauna. Introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand from Britain in the early 1900s to aid coastal land reclamation, it became a conservation concern by the 1960s, prompting control efforts in the South Island from the 1970s. This study presents a detailed S. anglicus eradication case study from the Marlborough Sounds, where detections are nearing zero. We model changes in detection probability over time in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound, a complex estuarine catchment. We aim to inform control efforts and assess the effectiveness of ongoing management, by evaluating the probability of non-detection as a proxy for functional eradication. Using data from the Department of Conservation (DOC), we analysed detections across 79 search blocks between 2013 and 2024. A generalised linear mixed model was used to generate predicted detections through to 2040, using a modified dataset with pseudo-zero values for probable absences. The data were modelled as presence/absence with a binomial distribution, to identify the first year with a <0.01 probability of a positive detection (upper 99% confidence limit). Results suggest that by 2032, the likelihood of further detections under current management practices is remote, and that functional eradication may have occurred. We interpret this decline in detection probability as indicative of management success. Model outputs can support decision-making as to when active surveillance might reasonably be ceased. To accelerate the tail-end of eradication efforts, we recommend intensifying search effort and widening delimitations within the catchment over the next five years, to ensure removal of any remaining individuals. We also propose the use of environmental DNA as a cost-effective backstop for after operational wind-down."

    "content": "Climate warming is altering the timing of seasonal growth in cold-temperate and boreal ecosystems, with potential consequences for forests on multiple continents. It has been hypothesized that in a warming climate, earlier growth in spring might lead to a longer growing season and thus higher annual total growth. However, whether the period of active growth is longer in a warming climate is unclear, as is whether changes in growth rate might reinforce or offset the effect of changing growing season length in modulating annual total growth. Understanding responses in growth to warming is crucial to projecting forest dynamics under future climate change. To address this, we experimentally warmed (by +1.62 and 3.26 {degrees}C on average) open-air southern boreal forest plots for 14 years (2010 to 2023) and measured juvenile height growth from spring until fall for 20 tree and shrub species, with a total of 11,565 individual-year growth trajectories. Across all species and in various canopy (open, closed) and rainfall (ambient, reduced) contexts, experimental warming consistently advanced the timing of height growth (4.32 days per 3 {degrees}C warming). However, species differed in their annual total growth responses. Evergreen gymnosperms such as spruce, fir, and pine tended to exhibit suppressed annual total growth under warming (-15.8% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by a shorter duration of active growth, despite an earlier start, with little change in relative growth rate. In contrast, deciduous angiosperms and non-native shrubs often show enhanced annual total growth under warming (19.3 and 37.4% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by faster rate, longer duration, or a combination of both. More broadly, species with a more conservative lifestyle responded less positively in the duration and rate of growth, thus placing them at a disadvantage under warming. These contrasting responses challenge assumptions that an earlier start of the growing season universally enhances growth and highlight how warming may shift both the timing and pace of growth and thus alter community composition within mixed-species forests."

    "content": "The location at which a species assemblage is observed can be uncertain, for example in fisheries where catch composition is recorded accurately but location data may be coarse or inaccurate. In such cases, spatial signals in observed species compositions can help identify and refine uncertain locations. This study explored three approaches for location estimation using species composition data: 1) a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that jointly estimates species distributions and location uncertainty, 2) an inverse prediction method that uses a fitted SDM to identify the most likely location given new species data, and 3) the direct modeling of location as the response variable. Each approach requires a subset of observations with accurate locations to quantify the spatial patterns in species distributions. All three methods were useful and reasonably accurate: for the simulated data the average distance error (distance to true location) was 15% the size of the domain, and for the real data this error was 20-100 km. When only some locations are uncertain, the hierarchical approach is valuable due to its integrated estimation of location and species parameters. When many locations are uncertain, the other approaches seem more suitable. Inverse prediction is ideal when prior information is available to constrain the location estimation. Direct modelling (although causally spurious) is well suited to large datasets, with multivariate random forests often providing the most accurate location estimates. These methods can enhance spatial data quality in ecological monitoring and help develop tools for improving inaccurate or deliberately misreported fishing locations."

Here, we provide direct evidence for active anaerobic metabolism in the GVC by measuring hydrogen (H2), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) production, indicative of microbial fermentation, nitrogen fixation and denitrification. Changes in GVC H2 concentrations after feeding suggest that feeding modulates substrate availability, which in turn influences microbial activity in this compartment. In bleached corals, the GVC remained consistently hypoxic and acidic, and anaerobic metabolic processes persisted across the diel cycle. These patterns suggest a shift in energy and nutrient cycling pathways within the bleached coral holobiont. Together, our findings identify the GVC as a dynamic site of microbial activity that may play an important role in holobiont carbon and nitrogen cycling, with potential implications for nutrient balance and coral resilience."

    "content": "1. Microclimates are critical for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behaviour, physiology, and species distributions. However, traditional physical heat-balance models for predicting ground temperatures in microhabitats often exhibit biases due to unaccounted environmental complexities and poorly constrained parameters. These limitations can hinder ecological research and conservation planning, particularly in the context of climate change. 2. In this study, we demonstrate how high-resolution drone-based mapping and machine learning can improve the accuracy of microclimate models. Using drone imagery, we generated detailed environmental maps, including solar radiation, vegetation indices, and skyview factors, to parameterize a physical heat-balance model. Validation with thermal maps derived from drone-mounted infrared cameras revealed systematic errors in the physical model's predictions, including over- and underestimations under specific environmental conditions. To address these errors, we applied a random forest machine learning model to predict and correct biases in new prediction maps. 3. Our results show that machine learning reduced mean absolute errors by over 30% and mean square errors by 50%, while consistently narrowing the range of prediction inaccuracies. Key factors driving biases, such as vegetation cover, solar radiation, and height above ground, were identified, offering valuable insights for improving physical models. The machine learning corrections not only improved accuracy but also highlighted parameters and processes that were previously underrepresented or oversimplified in traditional models. 4. These findings illustrate the potential of ML to improve microclimate predictions. While our drone-based approach is most applicable to open, sparsely vegetated habitats, the principle of ML bias correction can be extended to other systems as well. Correcting microclimate models with ML and observational data provides ecologists and conservation practitioners with a powerful framework for generating more accurate microclimate estimates. Such improvements deepen our understanding of species' responses to climate change and support climate-resilient management strategies."

    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.30.691431v1?rss=1",
    "content": "The malarial parasite emph{Plasmodium vivax} has infected humans for millennia. As such, alleles like the FY*O allele in the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and the sickle cell allele (HbS) have been naturally selected for in malaria-endemic regions because they confer resistance to malaria, thereby increasing the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying these protective alleles. As resistance becomes more common in a population, malaria incidence is expected to decline, reducing the evolutionary pressure for additional resistance. In this work, we explore the interaction between these processes. We construct a model with seasonality that tracks the frequency of Duffy genotypes and leverages fast/slow dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamics of malaria transmission and changes in the gene frequency of the DARC genotype. Specifically, we investigate how the burden of malaria changes with the fractions of people with the various DARC genotypes. We derive the basic reproduction number as the threshold condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and interpret the $R_0$ as a weighted sum of the cases generated by infected individuals of each genotype. Additionally, we calibrate our model using data from the Amazonas region in Brazil, which has a polymorphic population with respect to DARC, and still reports a substantial number of emph{P. vivax} cases. Analysis of our model determines the proportion of the population that must be Duffy-negative in order for the entire population to be protected against emph{P. vivax} without any further interventions. Furthermore, we assess how different proportions of Duffy-negative individuals influence the monthly incidence of emph{P. vivax} cases."

    "title": "From forest decline to salvage logging: cascading impacts on saproxylic beetle diversity",
    "link": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.28.690817v1?rss=1",
    "content": "Understanding the cascading effects of forest decline on saproxylic communities is fundamental for optimizing the management of disturbed forests toward biodiversity conservation objectives. We postulated that the nature and intensity of cascading pathways would vary along decline gradients, encompassing stages from stand decline to mortality and subsequent salvage logging, as mediated by shifts in habitat conditions and resource availability. This study was conducted across three representative European forest contexts: fir forests in the French Pyrenees, spruce forests in Bavaria (Germany), and oak forests in the lowlands of the Loire Valley (France). Within these systems, we assessed how the taxonomic and functional -diversity of saproxylic beetles responded to variations in both the diversity and density of deadwood and tree-related microhabitats (TreMs). Our analyses identified key cascading effects of stand decline and mortality that were shaped by the considered beetle guild and by the forest type, reflecting tree species-specific disturbance legacies. Stand decline and mortality produced distinct responses within saproxylic beetle assemblages, as different successional guilds preferentially utilized either dying or dead trees. The overall influence of decline processes was positive in conifer-dominated forests. TreMs played a central role in mediating cascading processes structuring saproxylic beetle communities throughout the forest decline continuum. The increase in TreM heterogeneity associated with stand decline or mortality enhanced saproxylic diversity, with exposed wood and trunk injuries identified as particularly influential microhabitats. Snags and large deadwood elements, especially in spruce forests, and deadwood diversity further contributed to sustaining high levels of beetle diversity. Conversely, salvage logging exerted detrimental effects on numerous guilds, primarily through reductions in TreM diversity, decreased TreM trait dispersion, and the depletion of saproxylic TreMs. Given the pronounced context dependency of the processes driving these cascading community dynamics, and considering the increasing frequency, severity, and spatial extent of forest disturbances and global forest decline, it is imperative to integrate this complexity into management and conservation frameworks. Addressing these mechanisms with greater precision will be critical for maintaining functional biodiversity within rapidly changing forest ecosystems."

    "content": "Zoonotic spillovers are becoming increasingly frequent, and the devastating effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrate our continued inability to combat their consequences effectively. Natural history museums can enhance the study of zoonoses by serving as valuable resources for understanding the ecology and evolutionary history of pathogens and their wildlife hosts. Despite the growing interest in the role museums can play in pathobiology research and zoonotic risk assessment, there remains a lack of centralized resources for locating tissue samples that may be leveraged for pathogen discovery. Using the worlds most significant global aggregator of museum specimens, The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we examined how such tools could be adopted to identify specimens that might be sources of viral genetic material. Focusing on tissue samples from the mammalian orders Rodentia and Chiroptera, speciose taxa that host a high diversity of known zoonotic viruses, we examined temporal, spatial, and taxonomic gaps and patterns in the available tissue samples. Our analyses reveal a heavy bias toward tissue samples collected from the Americas (and consequently, taxonomic groups found in the Americas), with most collected samples housed in North American institutions. This limits the scope of future pathogen discovery efforts and presents a barrier to pandemic preparedness in the Global South. We also examine gaps in metadata quality (e.g., descriptions of preservation method and storage medium) and outline recommendations for GBIF to facilitate future biosurveillance projects and effectively incorporate natural history museums into One Health disease research."

    "content": "Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an invasive parasitic nematode and zoonotic pathogen responsible for eosinophilic meningitis. Originally native to Southeast Asia, it is now globally distributed across tropical and subtropical regions and is approaching Europe, with Tenerife as a key hotspot. This study investigates the distribution and prevalence of A. cantonensis in Tenerife across three host groups (rats, gastropods, lizards). Based on prevalence data, we modelled its potential distribution using species distribution models (SDMs) and compared climatic conditions with Hawaii, a region with frequent human cases. Field surveys confirmed A. cantonensis in endemic and introduced gastropods (25.6%; 179/698), rats (21.5%; 14/79), and lizards (24.0%; 31/129), with local prevalence ranging from 2.4% to 41.6%. MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree models identified precipitation seasonality as the main driver of distribution, while prevalence was influenced primarily by tree cover density and climatic variability. Northeastern Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro showed the highest habitat suitability. However, overlap with densely populated areas was limited, possibly explaining the absence of reported human cases. The MESS analysis, based on climatic data from Hawaii, indicated moderate to high environmental similarity across most of the Canary Islands, except in northeastern Tenerife, where conditions were outside the range observed in Hawaii. A. cantonensis is firmly established in Tenerife, but human cases remain absent, likely due to limited human exposure, cultural practices, and geographic separation of parasite hotspots from urban zones. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating ecological and epidemiological data in zoonotic risk assessments."

    "content": "Species interactions are fundamental to maintaining biodiversity. However, how these interactions change over time in response to varying climatic conditions has been poorly explored. This gap limits our ability to identify how temporal changes in coexistence mechanisms sustain diverse communities. Here, we present a modeling approach, coupled with theory, to evaluate how temporal changes in species competitive and mutualistic interactions and intrinsic growth rates promote structural stability. We illustrate our framework using two highly replicated yet independent datasets: (1) annual plant grasslands and (2) wild bee assemblages in shrublands, both subjected to the same variation in rainfall over nine years. We found that both systems respond similarly to year-to-year rainfall changes despite their disparate evolutionary backgrounds. While rainfall variability fosters more diverse communities, prolonged drought leads to substantial biodiversity loss. Although the spatial context dependency modifies some responses, the structural stability of most communities persists through time, with clear winners and losers emerging under environmental variability. The main underlying mechanism determining the observed community stability is a combination of species-specific changes in their growth rates, an increase in the variability of interspecific interactions, and a reduction in the strength of self-limiting effects. Our results underscore the need to consider time-varying species interactions to understand community stability under contrasting climatic conditions and to predict how climate severity influences biodiversity loss."

    "content": "Spatial protections that exclude fisheries have long been used to manage and conserve marine species. Detecting the benefits of protected areas for fish within them and for adjacent fisheries (via spillover effects) is key to informing fisheries management yet also difficult. We leveraged an extensive dataset collected over 18 years by an alliance of four Indigenous Nations in Pacific Canada. Our analyses of those data quantified the benefits of spatial fishery closures, known as Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs), on 28 species of groundfish occupying a wide range of distances from RCAs (inside RCAs to {approx}150 km away). On average, body sizes and relative abundance increased by 1.1% and 11.0%, respectively, per 5 km-increase in RCA proximity. Variation around these average responses depended on the species' life history characteristics, RCA location, and historical impacts from commercial fishing. Additionally, the benefits of spatial protection increased with time since RCA implementation."

    "content": "Thermal drones offer significant advantages for monitoring wildlife in low-light conditions; however, detection performance is influenced by technical settings and environmental factors. This study evaluates the use of nocturnal drone surveys to detect macropods in Tasmania, with the aim of determining optimal flight parameters for balancing detection accuracy and survey efficiency. Field surveys were conducted in Narawntapu National Park using varying flight altitudes and image overlap settings, and detection rates were compared across thermal datasets. Manual annotations and basic thresholding method were used to quantify detection success. Results showed that detection rates were highest when surveys were conducted under cooler ambient temperatures and at moderate altitudes (e.g. 60 metres AGL) with 50% image overlap. These findings provide practical guidance for designing nocturnal drone surveys and offers baseline recommendations for using drone-mounted thermal sensors to monitor large-bodied, crepuscular mammals, with broader implications for scalable wildlife monitoring programs."

    "content": "Biofilms are key components of freshwater microbial communities, contributing critically to ecosystem functioning. Composed of both bacteria and protists, biofilm communities are shaped by environmental conditions and the lifestyle traits of their constituent organisms. Although biofilm and planktonic communities may share some taxa, the extent of the overlap and the factors driving community differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial and protist communities associated with Phragmites australis stem biofilms and planktonic fractions across five lakes spanning an eutrophication gradient in the Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland. The biofilm communities on reed stems were highly distinct from planktonic ones, sharing only a small core microbiome. The biofilm core not only exceeded that of planktonic communities but also contained characteristic taxa, identified via machine learning, that were distinct from planktonic assemblages, including several with potential roles in bioremediation and as bioindicators. Planktonic communities were strongly influenced by environmental factors, whereas Phragmites australis-associated epiphytic biofilm communities appeared more uniform across lakes, consistent with host-associated selection and potentially with lifestyle-related buffering. Moreover, biofilm suspensions exhibited higher apparent physiological activity per inoculum volume and broader substrate use under our assay conditions than the free-living communities. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the ecological significance of biofilms in freshwater systems and underscore the need to integrate both biofilm and planktonic fractions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to fully capture microbial diversity, function, and ecosystem resilience."

    "content": "Ecological studies aim to understand species distributions, yet the methods used to sample affect which species are detected (i.e., gear selectivity) and may be influenced by species traits. Interactions between traditional gear selectivity for marine fishes and their species traits have been studied, but such studies have generally not extended to selectivity of environmental DNA (eDNA). Here, we investigated which functional species traits (scale type, schooling behaviour, and position-in-water-column) are selected for by eDNA metabarcoding and beach seines in nearshore eelgrass, mixed eelgrass, and understory kelp habitats. Using data from 35 sites across southeast Alaska, we applied occupancy modeling to estimate detection of species traits by each gear type. Detection probability with eDNA was 27 times greater for species with deciduous scales compared to species with non-deciduous scales, and lower for species with plates (rather than scales). Conversely, species with plates showed greater odds of detection with beach seines. Given the novelty of eDNA sampling, quantifying interactions between functional traits and gear selectivity will be important to accurately characterize species distributions across marine habitats."

    "content": "The \"dilution effect\" hypothesis suggests that high host diversity can reduce the prevalence of certain zoonotic pathogens. Despite growing interest, its generality and practical relevance remain debated. In particular most previous studies have focused on large scale analyses or meta-analyses, limiting their potential use for zoonotic outbreak prevention. Here, we present an extensive field-based study of small mammals and their multiple pathogens to assess diversity-disease relationships at a local scale, revealing pathogen-specific patterns. While no significant association was detected between the prevalence of some pathogens and host diversity, others such as Orthopoxvirus and a strain of Mycoplasma haemomuris exhibited dilution effect patterns, whereas another Mycoplasma haemomuris strain and Mycoplasma coccoides displayed amplification effects. Crucially, we demonstrate that these contrasting outcomes are consistently explained by the host competence-abundance relationship. Our findings underscore the importance of host community composition and highlight the need to consider multiple pathogens when evaluating the ecological mechanisms underpinning the diversity-disease relationships."

    "content": "Invasive alien plant species pose a serious threat to biodiversity, especially in ecologically rich regions such as the Mediterranean Basin. Among the most affected habitats are coastal communities, which host many endemic taxa and provide valuable ecosystem services. One such invasive taxa is Kalanchoe xhoughtonii, an allegedly artificial hybrid. This plant, although having demonstrated strong invasive potential, still largely remains unrecognised as a taxon of concern in Mediterranean countries, at least in national official catalogues. In this study, we assess the impact of this hybrid on coastal communities, focusing on the European Union Habitat of Community Interest (HCI) 1240--''vegetated cliffs with endemic statices (Limonium spp.)''--at two sites along the southern coast of Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). Between 2022 and 2025, we conducted field surveys to document the population size, growth stages, and spatial competition with native species. Additionally, we gathered 1,422 iNaturalist occurrences of K. xhoughtonii to map its distribution across the Mediterranean Basin, assess its presence within Natura 2000 protected sites and within protected areas, including the HCI 1240, and determine its potential spread using ensemble ecological niche modelling with bioclimatic variables. Our results show that K. xhoughtonii forms dense monospecific patches in the surveyed areas that compete for space with two native Limonium species in southern Catalonia. Moreover, we confirmed 713 naturalised occurrences in the Mediterranean area, 107 were located within Natura 2000 protected sites and 58 within the HCI 1240 included in protected sites. Ecological niche modelling indicates high climatic suitability across 93% of western and 59% of eastern Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites containing the HCI 1240. The findings of this study highlight the invasive potential of K. xhoughtonii and support its inclusion in national catalogues of invasive species across Mediterranean basin countries. The study calls for systematic monitoring of the spread and ecological impact of this hybrid species in coastal community habitats."
