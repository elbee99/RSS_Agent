    "content": "A dual\u2010pathway strategy is proposed to enhance seawater electrolysis by incorporating SOx\u03b4\u2212 species into a Ni3S4@NiFe\u2010MOF heterostructure. Specifically, the SOx\u03b4\u2212 species coordinated with Fe sites breaks the symmetric charge distribution of Fe atoms and O ligands, for reducing the thermodynamic adsorption of Cl\u2212 ions. Simultaneously, the uncoordinated SOx\u03b4\u2212 species promote the formation of SOx\u03b4\u2212 anion\u2010rich surface layers, which repel Cl\u2212 ions through electrostatic interactions and suppress their kinetic migration. The dual\u2010pathway Cl\u2212 suppression enables highly selective and durable OER performance in alkaline seawater at industrial current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSuppressing anodic chlorine evolution while enhancing hydrogen production in seawater electrolysis requires simultaneous regulation of the Cl\u2212 adsorption behavior and inhibition of its kinetic migration. However, integrated strategies to mitigate the associated corrosive effects remain underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate a dual\u2010pathway strategy, where the Fe\u2010SOx\u03b4\u2212 bonding and the formation of SOx\u03b4\u2212 anion\u2010rich layers synergistically provide effective protection for SOx\u03b4\u2212\u2010Ni3S4@NiFe\u2010MOF/NF catalysts in seawater environments. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that partial SOx\u03b4\u2212 chemically coordinates with Fe sites, altering the local electronic structure and increasing the Cl\u2212 adsorption energy. Simultaneously, uncoordinated SOx\u03b4\u2212 leaches into the electrolyte and spontaneously forms the surface anion\u2010rich layers via polarization effect, hampering the kinetic migration of Cl\u2212. Benefiting from this dual protection, the catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 350\u00a0mV at 1.5 A cm\u22122 and superior stability over 600\u00a0h with a small decay rate of 0.93 \u00b5V h\u22121 in alkaline seawater. The assembled seawater electrolyzer presents a small cell voltage (1.74\u00a0V @ 1 A cm\u22122), high\u2010energy conversion efficiency (75.6%), and lower H2 production cost ($0.88 per GGE) than the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. The proposed dual\u2010pathway regulation strategy offers a new paradigm for the design of high\u2010performance chloride\u2010resistant catalysts.",

This device can generate high power output with great durability, and negative ions with high voltage electrostatic discharge\u2010based output, which enables moisture collecting and dust removal effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe electrostatic potential of particulate matter presents a promising avenue for energy harvesting; however, uncontrolled electrical discharge can pose ignition risks or cause damage in industrial settings. Previous approaches have relied on the introduction of additional particles or water, which limits their applicability and overlooks the hazards associated with high electric potentials. Here, we present a novel, contactless electricity generation method using only practical compressed air and a Tesla turbine structure. Leveraging electrostatic charges and the viscous force of compressed air, this system achieves peak outputs of 800\u00a0V and 2.5 A at 325\u00a0Hz without requiring any additional particles. Furthermore, the high\u2010voltage output facilitates the neutralization and collection of dust and moisture by generating negative ions. This integrated approach expands the practical potential of static electricity\u2010based energy harvesting for industrial applications.",

However, their delocalized s/p electrons and the directional nature of p orbitals result in intrinsically weak binding to ORR intermediates, limiting catalytic activity. In this study, we develop main\u2010group dual\u2010atom catalysts (DACs) based on the s\u2010block element calcium (Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS) to address this limitation. The dual\u2010atom design enables a dual\u2010channel mechanism involving \u03c3\u2010donation and \u03c0\u2010backdonation through p\u2013p orbital hybridization between Ca 3p orbitals at the Ca2 dual\u2010atom sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate enhanced p\u2013p orbital coupling between Ca 3p and O 2p states, leading to optimized p\u2010electron configurations that promote O2 activation and facilitate the adsorption of oxygen intermediates during the ORR. Notably, Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS achieves a half\u2010wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91\u00a0V and exhibits excellent four\u2010electron ORR selectivity, significantly outperforming its single\u2010atom analogue. Furthermore, Ca2\u2010N\u2010HCS demonstrates exceptional durability and stable performance in Zn\u2013air batteries across a wide temperature range (\u221240\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C).

    "content": "The pre\u2010leaching of inactive oxide is proposed to decouple the coordination anion substitution from the active metal oxidation processes, moderating reconstruction of the pre\u2010catalyst. In MoO2/NixSy, the preferential formation and re\u2010adsorption of MoO42\u2212 derived from sacrificial agent (MoO2) reduces the disorder of the NiOOH active phase, enabling exceptional activity and stability for industrial\u2010grade water splitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWater electrolysis represents a promising approach for producing green hydrogen fuel from abundant renewable energy sources, offering a viable solution to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels. However, the leaching of active species from catalysts due to dynamic reconstruction poses significant durability challenges, limiting practical applications despite advances in catalytic activity. Herein, we introduce an innovative and versatile design featuring an inactive pre\u2010leaching region within the pre\u2010catalyst to decouple coordination anion substitution from active metal oxidation, thereby mitigating catalyst reconstruction. We fabricate a MoO2/NixSy system, utilizing readily oxidizable MoO2 as a sacrificial component. This design effectively isolates the coordination anion substitution (Sx\u2212\u2192OH\u2212\u2192O2\u2212) around nickel sites from the oxidative transformation of nickel atoms in NixSy. Consequently, the MoO2/NixSy system evolves into a dual oxyanion co\u2010adsorbed NiOOH, marked by low structural disorder and strong Ni\u2500O bonds for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This synergistic co\u2010adsorption enhances electron transfer, yielding an impressive overpotential of 253\u00a0mV at 1000\u00a0mA cm\u22122 and exceptional stability over 300 h. Scaled for industrial water electrolyzers, MoO2/NixSy maintains stable operation at 8000\u00a0mA for 360 h, achieving a record\u2010low voltage of 1.70\u00a0V, corresponding to energy consumption of 4.07\u00a0kWh m\u22123 H2.",

However, Ru\u2010type catalysts have suffered from unbalanced intermediate adsorption/desorption, resulting in suboptimal HOR activity and limited long\u2010term stability, particularly under practical AEMFC operating conditions. Here, we present a RuCo core\u2013shell nanoplate featuring a Co core and an atomically scaled Ru skin shell (Co@Ru NPs), in which the unique core\u2013shell structure and atomic Ru skin effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption balance of H* and OH* species while enhancing reaction kinetics in AEMFCs. Consequently, the Co@Ru NPs\u2010based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density (PPD) of 1.57\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122 in H2\u2010O2 with an ultralow Ru loading of 0.05\u00a0mg\u00a0cm\u22122, which enables an exceptional anode specific power of 31.4\u00a0W\u00a0mgRu\u22121, outperforming those of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art Ru\u2010type AEMFCs. Moreover, the Co@Ru NPs\u2010based fuel cell can be run stably at 0.5\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122 for over 300\u00a0h, demonstrating the excellent stability of Co@Ru NPs for practical fuel cell applications.",
