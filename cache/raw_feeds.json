    "content": "In this work, a self\u2010restructuring Fe\u2010based perovskite catalyst is developed, leveraging in situ amorphization to achieve a \u201cself\u2010improving\u201d behavior for hydrogen evolution. When integrated into a custom\u2010built membrane\u2010less electrolyzer, the system demonstrates a record\u2010breaking 1000\u00a0h stability, providing a robust and practical pathway for the development of next\u2010generation water electrolysis technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBalancing stability and activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis remains challenging for advanced electrolysis technologies. This work introduces a synergistic design strategy to tackle the challenge with in situ surface restructuring. Fe\u2010based double perovskite is developed with an optimal electronic structure for HER catalysis, delivering an overpotential of 325\u00a0mV in 0.1\u00a0m KOH and 184\u00a0mV in 1\u00a0m KOH at 10\u00a0mA/cm2, among the best reported. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited remarkable self\u2010improving stability, with specific activity increasing 1.98 times at 300\u00a0mV overpotential after 20 h, due to the restructuring of an amorphous layer confirmed with transmission electron microscopy. To demonstrate practical utility, the catalyst was integrated into an active flow membraneless electrolyzer (AFME), a promising technology that is currently limited by instability. The device demonstrated outstanding operational stability for 1000 h at 50\u00a0mA/cm2, with a minimal decay rate of 0.25\u00a0mV/h, establishing a new benchmark for membraneless systems. This work not only presents a powerful strategy for designing self\u2010improving catalysts but also validates its practical efficacy in next generation electrolyzer technologies, paving the way for cost\u2010effective green hydrogen production.",

    "content": "This review summarizes how multiscale interface regulation, through synergistic optimization, improves the performance of critical battery components, including zinc anode coatings, separators, and hydrogel electrolytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc\u2010ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large\u2010scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their commercialization is hampered by notorious zinc anode issues, including uncontrolled dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions. Multiscale interfacial regulation has recently emerged as a transformative strategy to address these challenges. This approach overcomes the limitations of single\u2010interface modulation by constructing multilayer structures and optimizing interface coupling, thereby providing effective anode protection. To promote uniform zinc plating and suppress side reactions, this review comprehensively summarizes multiscale strategies that span the optimization of multi\u2010physical fields, zinc deposition orientation, and electrolyte solvation structures. We systematically present recent advances in applying these multiscale strategies to zinc foil, zinc powder, and host\u2010based anodes, as well as separators and hydrogel electrolytes, with a focus on their design principles, underlying mechanisms, and scenario\u2010specific applicability. Furthermore, we elucidate how this technology achieves synergistic optimization of ion transport, deposition behavior, and the interfacial environment through functionally complementary multilayer, Janus, or gradient interfaces, thereby systematically mitigating zinc anode failure. Finally, future research directions and challenges are discussed, emphasizing that a profound mechanistic understanding coupled with rational design is pivotal for unlocking the full potential of next\u2010generation AZIBs.",

    "content": "Simplified Y6\u2010analogs featuring vinylene\u2010bridged DA\u2032D cores enable high\u2010efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) processed entirely under ambient air. The BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F\u2010based devices achieve a certified PCE of 19.0% with outstanding thermal and photostability, demonstrating that rational acceptor design can overcome the efficiency\u2013stability trade\u2010off and advance scalable, eco\u2010friendly OSC manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAchieving high efficiency and long\u2010term stability under ambient processing conditions remains a critical hurdle for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we report two new Y6\u2010analogs\u2014BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F (4F) and BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104Cl (4Cl)\u2014featuring vinylene (v)\u2010bridged DA\u2032D cores, designed to improve the material's scalability while maintaining the structural advantages of Y6\u2010type acceptors. Morphological and device\u2010level investigations reveal that these M\u2010Y6 derivatives facilitate thermodynamically stable molecular packing and favorable crystalline orientation, even when fully processed in air. Incorporation of 4F into a layer\u2010by\u2010layer ternary architecture with D18/L8\u2010BO via a reproducible air\u2010processing protocol results in a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%, among the highest reported for conventional OSCs fabricated under ambient conditions. Moreover, 4F\u2010based devices demonstrate exceptional thermal and photostability, retaining over 80% of their initial PCE after extended aging under the ISOS\u2010L\u20101 protocol without encapsulation. These improvements are attributed to the enhanced crystallinity, vertical molecular alignment, and morphological robustness imparted by the 4F acceptor. This study identifies BT(BO)\u2010v\u2010T(C12)\u20104F as a promising air\u2010processable acceptor for scalable OSCs that combine high efficiency with long\u2010term operational durability.",

    "link": "https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202506618?af=R",
    "content": "This work presents Echo\u2010vision, a compact and deformable ultrasonic platform that integrates acoustic energy harvesting and echo imaging. A piezoelectric transducer, a stretchable meta\u2010lens, and a mechanical iris jointly enable controllable focusing. The harvested energy can be stored to power micro\u2010LEDs and micro\u2010motors, while the tunable focus supports varifocal imaging with subwavelength resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nUltrasonic technologies enable imaging, detection, and communication across biomedical and underwater applications, yet rigid architectures with fixed focusing often limit multifunctional integration and depth\u2010of\u2010field control. Conventional systems typically trade off aperture, coverage, and resolution, without considering unified power capture and imaging. Here, we present the prototype of Echo\u2010vision, a bio\u2010inspired ultrasonic platform that unifies acoustic energy harvesting and varifocal imaging in a single mechanically reconfigurable design. Mimicking ocular mechanisms, Echo\u2010vision combines an active device, a stretchable meta\u2010lens, and a mechanically actuated iris to realize controllable wavefront engineering and bidirectional electro\u2010acoustic conversion. In the energy harvesting mode, focused ultrasound charged five 1000 \u00b5F capacitors to 2.25\u00a0V at an average charging rate of 10 \u00b5C/s, providing sufficient power to drive micro\u2010LEDs and micro\u2010motors. In the echo imaging mode, radial stretching relocates the focal plane from 10 to 20\u00a0mm, enabling varifocal imaging at multiple depths. Raster\u2010scanned reconstructions achieve subwavelength lateral (\u223c0.8\u03bb) and wavelength\u2010scale axial (1\u03bb) resolution. This dual\u2010function integration paves the way toward self\u2010powered acoustic systems for underwater exploration, soft\u2010robotic perception, and intelligent sensing.",
