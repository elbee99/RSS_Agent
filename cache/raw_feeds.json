    "content": "Applying a highly concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) trapped within a polymer matrix on the anode significantly enhances the cycling stability of lithium\u2010ion batteries with high\u2010loading electrodes. This spatial confinement of LiTFSI induces preferential decomposition at the anode surface, thereby forming a stable, inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer, while LiPF6 in the bulk electrolyte prevents aluminum current collector corrosion caused by LiTFSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAmong promising lithium salts for electrolyte in lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) forms a more stable inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer. However, its implementation is limited by severe aluminum current collector corrosion. Since lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) contributes a stable passivation layer for aluminum, a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte offers reduced corrosion. However, its corrosion inhibition capability is not complete. Herein, we propose a SEI\u2010stabilizing and corrosion\u2010preventing layer (SCL) that realizes spatial separation of salts, which confines concentrated LiTFSI within a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) network at the anode\u2010LiPF6 electrolyte interface. The locally high concentration of LiTFSI in SCL induces a kinetic preference that overrides the thermodynamic preference of LiPF6, which enables targeted decomposition of LiTFSI to form a robust SEI layer, while using only a small amount of LiTFSI. Furthermore, SCL demonstrates excellent corrosion\u2010inhibiting behavior compared to a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte. Consequently, SCL enables stable cycling of high\u2010loading (21.4\u00a0mg cm\u22122) practical NCM811/graphite full cells with 93.57% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high current density of 2.2\u00a0mA cm\u22122. This strategy enables selective electrochemical reactions through spatial confinement to enhance LIB performance, while suppressing side reactions and reducing costs, providing a scalable approach for next\u2010generation electrolyte design.",

This remodeling induces the reconstruction of band structure and the expansion of hexagonal region, which accelerates the movement of both electrons and ions within the material and electrode structures. The structural enhancement facilitates the fast\u2010charging and cycle stability of a pure silicon anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSustainable electrification continues to drive growing interest in high\u2010performance lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), which are essential energy storage systems for this transition. However, conventional graphite\u2010based LIBs cannot meet the stringent requirements of next\u2010generation applications, necessitating advanced alternatives. Herein, we report the design of fluorine\u2010incorporated silicon (FIS) nanostructures through a novel solid\u2013vapor\u2013solid synthesis method that integrates metallothermic reduction with combined top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up processes.

Interstitial F modifies the direct\u2010allowed band structure of Si and expands lithium penetration pathways, thereby enhancing charge transport through improved electronic conductivity and ion migration. Meanwhile, surface\u2010bound F induces superhydrophobicity, enabling hydrofluoric acid\u2010free processing during both synthesis and electrode fabrication.

    "content": "To further enhance the environmental sustainability and cost advantages of sodium\u2010ion batteries, it is essential to develop low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free layered oxide cathode materials. From the perspectives of cost and electrochemical performance, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in sodium\u2010ion batteries, with the resulting key scientific challenges and effective solution strategies summarized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) are the most widely used commercial rechargeable batteries, but the stable supply of key raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt faces challenges. Sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as potential alternatives and complements to LIBs due to similar working principles and the abundance of sodium resources. Layered oxide cathode materials (LOCMs) are recognized as one of the most promising practical cathodes for SIBs because of mature synthesis technology and satisfactory energy density. However, the use of nickel in LOCMs for SIBs has raised concerns about environmental pollution during nickel production and the risk of price volatility stemming from the widespread application of high\u2010nickel LOCMs for LIBs. Therefore, developing low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free LOCMs is crucial for enhancing the environmental friendliness and cost advantages of SIBs. For low\u2010cost LOCMs, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in SIBs, and summarizes the resulting critical scientific challenges (Fe migration, Mn dissolution, Jahn\u2010Teller effect, Na deficiency, and thermal instability). Economic efficiency assessment based on cost and electrochemical properties indicates that low\u2010cost LOCMs exhibit the highest cost\u2010performance ratio. Finally, to accelerate the commercialization of cost\u2010effective SIBs technologies, this review outlines promising development pathways of low\u2010cost LOCMs.",

    "content": "This study reports an integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membrane fabricated via a bottom\u2010up relay phase inversion strategy, overcoming the long\u2010standing trade\u2010off in traditional porous membranes. Bilateral skin layers protect the macropore support layer, suppressing fouling and enhancing mechanical robustness. Tunable sub\u2010nanometer pores and an integrated symmetric architecture align well with flow batteries, enabling efficient and durable operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nA bottom\u2010up relay strategy is first proposed to fabricate integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membranes (macropore layer between bilateral skin layers) by ingeniously introducing a non\u2010solvent carrier. Benefiting from the phase inversion relay process, bilateral skin layers can be tailored freely, where ethylene glycol in the non\u2010solvent carrier effectively regulates the structure of the bottom skin layer by adjusting the ratio of free water to bound water. Thus, a dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane is designed and applied in a vanadium flow battery (VFB), that features symmetric skin layers (\u223c600\u00a0nm) with sub\u2010nanometer (\u223c4.5\u00a0\u00c5) pores. The symmetric structure reduces the pressure required for proton migration via the Vehicle mechanism, and the sub\u2010nanometer pores effectively separate vanadium ions from protons by size exclusion, breaking the trade\u2010off in traditional membranes. Moreover, the bilateral skin layers protect the macropore layer against the vanadium fouling and mechanical damage. Furthermore, the formation mechanism and ion transport dynamics of the dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane are analyzed by molecular dynamics and multi\u2010physical field simulation. As a result, the optimized membrane enables stable VFB operation for over 6000 cycles at 200\u00a0mA cm\u22122 with energy efficiency of \u223c83.6%. This work provides an effective approach to prepare integrated symmetric membranes with bilateral skin layers.",

The fundamental mechanisms governing its high performance have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that centrosymmetry breaking in [001] preferentially oriented \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 thin films (POF) arises from inevitable anisotropic strain during film formation. Using circular polarization\u2010dependent pump\u2010probe transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe Rashba\u2010type band splitting exclusively in POF, indicating symmetry breaking. Angle\u2010dependent X\u2010ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) reveal significant residual stress in POF compared to randomly oriented films (ROF), confirming strain\u2010induced lattice distortion. Furthermore, time\u2010resolved PL and microwave conductivity measurements reveal top\u2010back inhomogeneous carrier dynamics and anisotropic charge carrier mobility, supporting the presence of the anisotropic strain\u2010induced symmetry breaking.

However, the commercially used iridium\u2010based anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in PEMWEs still suffer from notably poor reactivity. At present, the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) is an important route to achieve both high activity and durability in OER. Nevertheless, the performance of conventional Ir\u2010based crystalline OER catalysts following the OPM pathway remains far below their theoretical limit, which is significantly hindered by two intrinsic limitations. First, their rigid lattice structures prevent the shortening of metal\u2010metal distances, which is essential to facilitate the rate\u2010determining O*\u2500O* dimerization. Second, the repulsion between O* adsorbates during OER inevitably weakens the metal = O* bond and undermines the overall oxygen evolution efficiency. Herein, we report that an amorphous IrMOx catalyst elegantly overcomes the limitations of the OPM pathway by virtue of its dynamic surface structure and strong oxophilicity of M.\u00a0 The dynamic surface structure promotes O*\u2500O* coupling, while the oxophilic nature of M compensates for the inherent weakening of the metal = O* bond during OER. Because of that, the catalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance, along with excellent catalytic durability over 1200 h\u2019 PEM testing.",

By encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles with an atomically thin carbon layer, the lattice expansion of Co3O4 during Kirkendall oxidation is constrained to a controllable strain range of 0.2\u20131.8%. This approach establishes a strain\u2010activity relationship for the oxygen evolution reaction in oxides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile Kirkendall oxidation (KO) facilely fabricates transition metal oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), it concomitantly triggers detrimental lattice expansion. For Co3O4, an appealing IrO2\u2010alternative catalyst, KO generates a free lattice expansion above 2.4%, resulting in suboptimal activity and stability. Here, we design a confined KO approach and coat the precursor Co nanoparticles with atomic carbon layers, enabling controllable lattice expansion of Co3O4 between 0.2% and 1.8%. For the first time, a strain\u2010dependent OER activity of Co3O4 is established in acidic media, with an expansion strain of 1.4% exhibiting the lowest overpotential of 377\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122.

    "content": "The densification process of Li6PS5Cl powders with varying particles size distributions reveals differences in smaller and larger distributions. Higher strain is revealed for the smaller particle size distribution from X\u2010ray diffraction. Discrete element method simulations uncover that the reason for the higher strain is not the particle size itself, but rather the larger inhomogeneity of particles in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid\u2010state battery fabrication requires the densification of solid electrolytes to achieve optimal cycling performance and high energy density. However, the underlying compaction mechanisms of these electrolytes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of pressure consolidation on the ionic conductor Li6PS5Cl with particle size distributions (PSD) ranging from 4 to 40 \u00b5m. Heckel analysis reveals that samples with smaller PSDs exhibit higher compressibility at lower pressures. X\u2010ray diffraction peak profiling shows that applied pressure induces lattice strain, leading to peak broadening, while pair distribution function analysis demonstrates a reduction in coherence length upon pressing. Dark\u2010field X\u2010ray microscopy further provides spatially resolved orientation maps, uncovering intragranular structural variations within individual Li6PS5Cl agglomerates after compression. To better understand the origin of stress fluctuations, we performed discrete element method simulations using the experimental PSDs. The results indicate that smaller particles and broader PSDs experience higher stresses, whereas monodisperse systems do not exhibit significant stress fluctuations with position or particle size. This suggests that the high strain observed cannot be attributed solely to smaller particles, but rather to size inhomogeneity. Overall, these findings highlight that both particle size and its distribution play a critical role in processing solid electrolytes for solid\u2010state batteries.",

The electrode demonstrates ultralow capacity decay during long\u2010term cycling in both potassium\u2010 and sodium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPotassium\u2010ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are promising next\u2010generation energy storage technologies because of their abundant and low\u2010cost raw materials. However, anodes for PIBs/SIBs often exhibit poor cycling stability, mainly due to particle fragmentation, loss of electrical connectivity, and continuous electrolyte decomposition from repetitive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these challenges, a biomimetic pomegranate\u2010like core\u2010shell SnP2O7@PC anode (CSP\u2010SnP2O7@PC) is synthesised through pyrolysis\u2010driven Kirkendall effect of tin\u2010based phosphonate metal\u2010organic framework (MOF). This multi\u2010scale design integrates several key features. At the molecular scale, the in situ formation of Sn\u2010P\u2010O bonds reduces K+ diffusion barriers. The nanoscale dispersion of SnP2O7 within conductive carbon matrix promotes efficient electron and ion transport. Furthermore, microscale structural engineering creates pre\u2010reserved voids to accommodate volume expansion, suppress SEI overgrowth, and prevent cracking.

However, their application is often limited by insufficient stability resulting from excessive swelling. This work presents a strategy to achieve efficient, safe and stable operation of a 24 \u00b5m thin hydrocarbon membrane by combining a modified polymer structure with a reinforcement layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHydrocarbon (HC) membranes have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of water electrolyzers. However, their low mechanical integrity under electrolysis conditions, due to severe swelling, poses a challenge for industrial\u2010scale applications. Here, we present a 12\u00a0\u00b5m\u2010thick sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone) (sPPS) membrane reinforced with a porous polyethylene (PE) substrate. The PE substrate reduces in\u2010plane swelling by a factor of 7 (10% vs 69%) and improves mechanical stability (440\u00a0MPa vs 50\u00a0MPa) in water at 60\u00b0C. Under electrolysis conditions, a 24\u00a0\u00b5m thick sandwich of two reinforced membranes shows stable operation over more than 2000\u00a0h in a constant current hold at 1\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122 conducted at 60\u00b0C (first 1000 h) and 80\u00b0C (remaining 1000 h) with only 6\u00a0\u00b5V\u00a0h\u22121 of voltage deviation within the last 500 h. With a potential of 1.67\u00a0V and a hydrogen in oxygen content of 1\u00a0vol% at 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122, the PFAS\u2010free membrane clearly outperforms a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art reference (Nafion\u2010N211: 1.73\u00a0V and 1.5\u00a0vol% at 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122).",

Electrochemical discharge better preserves the composition and layered structure of Ni\u2010rich cathode materials while minimizing residual lithium compounds. These findings highlight electrochemical discharge as a promising preprocessing step for closed\u2010loop direct recycling of lithium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption has significantly boosted the demand for lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), creating an urgent need for sustainable recycling strategies. Discharging end\u2010of\u2010life LIBs is a critical preprocessing step before recycling. Electrical discharge via cables is the current industrial state of the art for large battery packs, whereas electrochemical discharge (discharging batteries in solutions) offers a reliable alternative for smaller and mixed waste streams. This study compares electrical and electrochemical discharge methods and examines their effects on the morphology and composition of electrode materials from spent LIBs. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of electrochemical discharge to enable a closed\u2010loop direct recycling process by recovering high\u2010quality active materials from spent LIBs. Characterization results reveal that the lithium content is higher on negative electrode sheets after electrical discharge than after electrochemical discharge. Unreacted lithium on Ni\u2010rich layered oxides can form residual lithium compounds, such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH), which can trigger undesirable side reactions. PXRD analysis indicates that positive electrode materials subjected to electrochemical discharge retain their layered structure with minimal cation mixing, unlike those subjected to electrical discharge. Overall, the findings demonstrate that electrochemical discharge is more effective in preserving the chemical composition and structural integrity of active materials than conventional electrical discharge methods.",

Quantitative MST, NMR, and GC\u2010MS analysis resolves inactive\u2010lithium species and electrolyte component loss, revealing distinct electrolyte degradation pathways and guiding safer, longer\u2010lasting fast\u2010charge battery designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium plating on graphite anodes is a critical degradation pathway in lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), yet quantitative decoupling of its contribution from normal anode aging remains challenging. Here, we designed controlled Li plating tests using negative\u2010to\u2010positive (N/P) ratio\u00a0<\u00a01 LiFePO4/graphite cells and then compared them with practical fast\u2010charging cells (N/P\u00a0>\u00a01), quantifying the decomposition of each electrolyte component (solvent, salt, additives) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry titration (MST), and gas chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry (GC\u2010MS). Controlled Li plating occurs after full graphite lithiation, and it leads to rapid vinylene carbonate (VC) depletion, time\u2010dependent non\u2010Faradaic consumption of hexafluorophosphate (PF6\u2212)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)/ethylene carbonate (EC), and more organic solid\u2010electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation at higher rates. In routine fast\u2010charging aging, Li plating occurs before graphite saturation, and we find pronounced EMC consumption under high\u2010rate conditions compared with low \u2010 rate. Our comparative analysis indicates that VC consumption during fast charging originates not only from plating but also significantly from baseline graphite aging. Li plating likely induces SEI rupture, leading to direct contact with electrolyte, thus more organic SEI formation. This quantitative study enables decoupling of Li plating\u2010induced side reactions from general aging without plating, informing battery design and predictive aging models.",

However, issues such as dendrite growth and side reactions hinder their practical adoption. Cellulose\u2010based gel electrolytes (CGEs) have recently emerged as promising materials to mitigate these challenges. By inhibiting zinc dendrite formation and enhancing interfacial stability, CGEs improve cycling longevity and safety in ZIBs. This review begins by classifying gel electrolytes and outlining the distinctive benefits of CGEs prepared via crosslinking and non\u2010crosslinking strategies. It then systematically examines recent developments in CGEs for use with various cathode materials and in multifunctional ZIBs configurations. Finally, the environmental merits and compelling electrochemical properties of CGEs are highlighted, together with a forward\u2010looking discussion on their role in next\u2010generation ZIBs and related future research directions. This work provides a timely and comprehensive resource that integrates materials design with electrochemical insights, offering valuable guidance for the rational development of CGEs.",

    "content": "High resolution electron holography was used to image the projected electric potential of ordered water layers at the interface to a platinum (111) electrode. The observed reorganization of the water layers upon applying external potentials suggests that the electric potential drop of the electric double layer is mainly carried by the polarization field of ordered water dipoles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nImaging atomic structure and electric fields of the electric double layer at electrode\u2010water interfaces is essential for understanding electrochemical reactions. The wave properties of electrons in an environmental transmission electron microscope were used to reconstruct the atomic scale electric potentials of a platinum (111) interface in water by phase shifting electron holography. This progress allowed the observation of ordered water layers at the dynamic state of the platinum (111) surface and the water reorganization under applied electric potentials. The obtained projected electric potential of the Pt\u2010water interface is quantitatively compared to ab\u2010initio molecular dynamics simulations, revealing an extended ordered water region. We conclude that the potential drop at the Pt \u2010H2O interface is mainly carried by the polarization field of the ordered water structure. The impact of different surface Pt configurations and the presence of adsorbates on the ordered structure are discussed.",

    "content": "<p>Nature Chemistry, Published online: 20 January 2026; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-02035-z\">doi:10.1038/s41557-025-02035-z</a></p>Achieving charge separation with minimal energy loss remains a key challenge in photocatalysis, but traditional approaches often suffer from rapid charge recombination or inefficient energy utilization. Now it has been shown that symmetry-breaking charge separation within organic crystalline nanoparticles can generate long-lived charge-separated states, enabling efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.",
