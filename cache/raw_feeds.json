    "content": "We have rationally designed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) between the perovskite and hole transport layer to simultaneously mitigate defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in inorganic CsPbI3\u2010xBrx perovskite solar cells. As a result, the optimized device achieves an improved power conversion efficiency, increasing from 19.96% to 22.19%. Furthermore, the hydrophobic molecular structure of the chiral modifier significantly enhances the environmental stability of the solar cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nChiral materials exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to their non\u2010centrosymmetric structure. However, the influence of chiral configurations on halide vacancy repair and phase stability remains poorly understood, hindering the development of effective chiral passivation strategies for all\u2010inorganic perovskite solar cells. In this work, we rationally constructed chirality\u2010mediated interfaces between the perovskite and hole transport layer using R\u2010/S\u2010N\u2010(9\u2010fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)\u2010allylglycine (RAC\u2010NFA) to simultaneously suppress defect\u2010mediated non\u2010radiative recombination and phase instability in CsPbI3\u2010xBrx solar cells. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that RAC\u2010NFA operates via a \u201cstereoselective complementarity\u201d mechanism, which not only inhibits halide vacancy formation through \u201clock\u2010and\u2010key\u201d coordination but also drives thermodynamically favorable secondary crystal growth and surface reconstruction, leading to larger, high\u2010quality grains. Additionally, the densely packed aromatic Fmoc groups at grain boundaries effectively suppress phase transition and moisture/oxygen penetration. RAC\u2010NFA modification further optimizes band alignment to enhance hole extraction and transport. Through these synergistic effects, the CsPbI3\u2010xBrx device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 22.19%, among the highest reported for such materials, while retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 800 h in ambient air. This work presents a synergistic passivation strategy that concurrently improves efficiency and stability, offering a promising route toward the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "content": "This review highlights how high configurational entropy and cocktail effects in HE\u2010PBAs helps in mitigating the intrinsic challenges of conventional PBAs as battery electrodes and electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions, with deep insights into the structure and electrochemical property relationship. Further, a perspective on the practical outcomes and potential for additional improvements is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh performance robust electrodes are demanding for next\u2010generation energy storage devices, especially to raise the energy density and cycle life of rechargeable batteries. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), a class of framework materials possessing a 3D structure have gained vast interest as battery electrodes due to a rich and multiple redox active sites offering tunable chemistry to reversibly store charges. Albeit the Jahn\u2013Teller distortions, structural phase transitions, low electronic conductivity, and lattice degradation certainly restrict the practicality of PBAs, requiring a rational engineering to exploit their properties. This review exclusively focuses on engineering the physical\u2010chemical\u2010electrochemical properties of PBA via high configurational entropy and the role of HE\u2010PBA toward activating the redox centers and improving the structure, cycle stability, and conductivity are elaborated. The entropically tuned HE\u2010PBAs endow synergistic \u201ccocktail effect\u201d benefitting structural robustness, alleviated/controlled phase transitions, multi\u2010electron redox activity, and performance improvements in batteries including lithium\u2010ion (Li\u2010ion), sodium\u2010ion (Na\u2010ion), lithium\u2010sulfur (Li\u2010S) and zinc\u2010ion (Zn\u2010ion) chemistries and catalytic conversion reactions. Further, the structure\u2010property relationship of HE\u2010PBAs in energy storage and catalytic systems are systematically discussed underpinning the role of redox elements in capacity retention, structural stability, phases transition, and cycle\u2010life. Alongside, a prospect on the practical outcomes and scope for further improvements are detailed.",

    "content": "All\u2010solid\u2010state Li\u2013S and Na\u2013S batteries rely on complex solid\u2010state sulfur conversion governed by intertwined chemical interactions. This Perspective establishes a chemistry\u2010centered framework to elucidate sulfur transformation, S\u2013C, S\u2013SSE, and SSE\u2013C interactions, as well as their coupling during fabrication and cycling. Dissecting these intrinsic mechanisms reveals critical constraints and design principles for high\u2010loading, low\u2010pressure all\u2010solid\u2010state sulfur batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state Li\u2013S and Na\u2013S batteries (ASSSBs) employing highly conductive sulfide solid electrolytes combine high energy density with improved safety by enforcing solid\u2013solid sulfur conversion and eliminating polysulfide shuttling. However, sulfide electrolytes possess narrow electrochemical stability windows, while sulfur's low conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics, and \u223c80% volume change further challenge high\u2010loading (>30 wt.% S, or > 3\u00a0mg cm\u22122) operation under practical stack pressures. This perspective adopts an intrinsic chemical framework to dissect sulfur conversion in ASSSBs, emphasizing the coupled chemistry of sulfur, conductive carbon, and sulfide electrolytes during both fabrication and cycling. Sulfur redox pathways in liquid versus solid\u2010state systems are compared, followed by an analysis of electrolyte stability, S/electrolyte interactions, and interphase evolution. The differences in redox pathways for Li\u2013S vs Na\u2013S are discussed. Strategies to enhance sulfur reactivity and to tailor electrolyte behavior are then evaluated, culminating in design principles for high\u2010loading, low\u2010pressure ASSSBs capable of meeting practical performance targets.",

    "content": "An \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d effect is introduced by grafting Mg2+ ions onto the surface of triethoxy\u20103\u2010(2\u2010imidazolin\u20101\u2010yl)propylsilane (DI)\u2010bridged Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 fillers (LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg) to decouple Li+\u2010coordination in PEO\u2010based electrolytes. Lewis\u2010acidic Mg2+ can competitively chelate with EO chains and TFSI\u2212 anions, leading to a loosened Li+\u2010coordination for fast Li+ conduction. Moreover, TFSI\u2212 anions trapped by Mg2+ are preferentially decomposed, forming a stable LiF/Li3N\u2010rich SEI layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe strong and excessive Li+\u2010coordination with ethylene oxide (EO) chains induces\u00a0an inadequate Li+ conduction and poor interfacial stability in polyethylene oxide (PEO)\u2010based electrolytes. Herein, we introduce an \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d strategy to decouple Li+\u2010coordination by leveraging other metal ions to compete with Li+ for coordination. This design is realized by grafting Lewis\u2010acidic Mg2+ sites, which possess moderate positive charge and coordination ability, onto the surface of triethoxy\u20103\u2010(2\u2010imidazolin\u20101\u2010yl)propylsilane (DI)\u2010bridged Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 fillers (denoted as LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg). With the homogeneous dispersion of LLZTO\u2010DI\u2010Mg within PEO matrix, Mg2+ sites readily chelate with EO and bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI\u2212) anions, inducing competitive Mg2+\u2010EO\u2010Li+ and Mg2+\u2010TFSI\u2212\u2010Li+ coordination structures. The resulting loosened Li+\u2010coordination environment enables high ionic conductivity (7.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121) and Li+ transference number (0.63), both essential for efficient ion transport in battery systems. Moreover, the preferentially formed Mg2+\u2010TFSI\u2212 promotes the generation of a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer enriched with LiF/Li3N, thereby improving interfacial stability. When applied in LiFePO4||Li and high\u2010voltage LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.1O2||Li full cells, the customized electrolyte demonstrates superior rate capability and long\u2010term cycling performance. This work highlights the significant potential of \u201cionic tug\u2010of\u2010war\u201d effect in regulating Li+ conduction and tailoring interphase chemistry for high\u2010performance solid\u2010state composite electrolytes.",

    "content": "Lithium extraction from brines offers a promising pathway for future lithium supply, but its substantial water and energy demands hinder practical deployment and have received limited attention. This work quantitatively demonstrates that water-sustainable extraction is achievable by recovering freshwater during lithium concentration while also identifying the associated energy requirements and technical constraints. A solar-powered lithium-water cogeneration system is further proposed that integrates purification, concentration, and water recovery, enabling water- and energy-sustainable operation across the full extraction workflow.",
