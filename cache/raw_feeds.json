    "content": "Constructing a structurally stable Superlattice\u2010V2O5 cathode with an ultra\u2010large interlayer spacing effectively suppresses vanadium dissolution and the resulting shuttle effect. Furthermore, the spacious ion channels and lower Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier enhance the active material utilization in thick electrodes. Ultimately, it enables zinc\u2010vanadium batteries with high specific capacity and ultra\u2010long cycle stability at low current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAqueous zinc\u2010vanadium batteries face severe capacity decay and rapid failure, particularly at low current densities (< 1 A g\u22121), primarily due to the poor structural stability of the vanadium cathode and corrosion by highly active free water, which severely hinders their practical application. Here, we propose the superlattice vanadium oxide (Superlattice\u2010V2O5) as a cathode material to improve the cycle stability at low current density. Its larger interlayer spacing of 21.5 \u00c5 reduces structural stress during hydrated Zn2+ insertion/extraction, thus mitigating structural collapse, and effectively weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the interlayer. Furthermore, the superlattice structure diminishes the release of highly active water molecules during the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and increases the dissolution energy of the VO2+ ion from 0.96 to 1.72\u00a0eV. These synergistic effects suppress vanadium dissolution and shuttling. Consequently, the Superlattice\u2010V2O5 achieves a specific capacity of 445.1 mAh g\u22121 at a low current density of 0.2 A g\u22121 and enables vanadium shuttle\u2010free cycling for 750 cycles (lasting 106 days). Furthermore, the superlattice structure facilitates ion insertion into the deep regions of the high mass loading electrode, which effectively improves active material utilization, thereby achieving a stability of 2800 cycles at 0.5 A g\u22121 with a mass loading of 19.3\u00a0mg cm\u22122.",

    "content": "A novel bipolar electrochromic architecture based on WO3 and polycarbazole enables panchromatic modulation from visible to NIR. This device achieves a remarkable 77.4% integrated optical contrast with fast switching (1.0 s/0.7 s) and outstanding cycling stability (95% retention after 20\u00a0000 cycles), paving the way for next\u2010generation smart windows with validated significant energy savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochromic technology has garnered significant attention for smart windows due to its dynamic solar regulation capability. However, current implementations suffer from limitations such as low optical contrast, slow switching speed, and poor cycling stability. This study addresses these challenges by designing a bipolar electrochromic architecture combining thermally\u2010cured WO3 and alkoxy\u2010functionalized polycarbazole derivatives (CTPAO1 and CTPAO3). The optimized ECD2 (based on WO3 and CTPAO3) achieves a comprehensive contrast of 77.4% (200\u20132350\u00a0nm) with a peak modulation of 87.5% at 730\u00a0nm. The device exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 95% of its optical contrast after 20\u00a0000 cycles. Notably, benefiting from efficient ion transport pathways, it also shows excellent switching kinetics with a coloration time of 1.0 s and a bleaching time of 0.7 s. Building energy efficiency simulations predict that smart windows incorporating ECD2 can achieve total annual energy savings ranging from 13.1% to 50.8% across five climate zones in China. The energy\u2010saving effect is particularly significant in Haikou, with an estimated annual saving of 56.5\u00a0kW h/m2. This work provides a feasible solution for high\u2010performance, energy\u2010efficient electrochromic smart windows.",

The prepared Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 cathode delivers a high energy density (\u223c425 Wh kg\u22121) and outstanding cycling stability (95.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 20 C), offering a promising strategy for advanced sodium\u2010ion battery development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nConstructing cathode materials combining high operating voltage with long\u2010term stability is critical for sodium\u2013ion batteries (SIBs). Although Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising candidate, its practical application is limited by low intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural distortion at high voltages. Herein, we regulate the configurational entropy by co\u2013introducing Cr3+, Al3+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ into NVP to develop a novel Na3.18V1.7(CrAlMgMnCu)0.3(PO4)3 (NVMP) cathode. Through the successful activation of the reversible V4+/V5+ redox couple at \u223c4.0\u00a0V, the configurational entropy regulation strategy in NVMP effectively enhances the intrinsic electronic conductivity and reaction kinetics. Concurrently, it optimizes the phase transition behavior during (de)intercalation, which collectively contributes to superior rate capability and long\u2013term cycling stability. As a result, NVMP exhibits an average operating voltage of 3.64\u00a0V and a high energy density of approximately 425\u00a0Wh\u00a0kg\u22121. Notably, it retains 95.9% of its initial capacity after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 20 C, demonstrating exceptional cycling stability.

This transition is driven by two cooperative effects: shortened Ir\u2013Ir distances; and enhanced oxygen hole formation on adsorbed oxygen species. As a result, L/D\u2010IrO2 delivers excellent PEMWE performance and high\u2010current durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nActivating robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pathways in acidic media remains a major challenge for scalable hydrogen production via proton\u2010exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, we report a lithiation/delithiation (L/D) engineering strategy that enables a mechanistic switch in IrO2 from the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to a radical oxygen coupling pathway. This transition is driven by two cooperative effects: shortened Ir\u2013Ir distances that geometrically favor O\u2013O coupling; and enhanced oxygen hole formation on adsorbed oxygen species (*Oads), promoting the generation of reactive Oads2\u2212x like intermediates. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate that these geometric and electronic modulations synergistically activate direct (*Oads\u2013*Oads) coupling. The L/D\u2010IrO2 catalyst achieves an ultralow OER overpotential of 204\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and delivers outstanding durability over 1200\u00a0h in 0.5\u00a0m H2SO4. Integrated into a PEMWE device, it enables a current density of 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122 at only 1.799\u00a0V, and stable operation at 500\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 for 1200\u00a0h, with extended high\u2010current durability from 1 to 3\u00a0A\u00a0cm\u22122.
