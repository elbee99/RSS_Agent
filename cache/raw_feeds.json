    "content": "Applying a highly concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) trapped within a polymer matrix on the anode significantly enhances the cycling stability of lithium\u2010ion batteries with high\u2010loading electrodes. This spatial confinement of LiTFSI induces preferential decomposition at the anode surface, thereby forming a stable, inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer, while LiPF6 in the bulk electrolyte prevents aluminum current collector corrosion caused by LiTFSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAmong promising lithium salts for electrolyte in lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) forms a more stable inorganic\u2010rich SEI layer. However, its implementation is limited by severe aluminum current collector corrosion. Since lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) contributes a stable passivation layer for aluminum, a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte offers reduced corrosion. However, its corrosion inhibition capability is not complete. Herein, we propose a SEI\u2010stabilizing and corrosion\u2010preventing layer (SCL) that realizes spatial separation of salts, which confines concentrated LiTFSI within a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) network at the anode\u2010LiPF6 electrolyte interface. The locally high concentration of LiTFSI in SCL induces a kinetic preference that overrides the thermodynamic preference of LiPF6, which enables targeted decomposition of LiTFSI to form a robust SEI layer, while using only a small amount of LiTFSI. Furthermore, SCL demonstrates excellent corrosion\u2010inhibiting behavior compared to a simply\u2010mixed LiPF6\u2010LiTFSI dual\u2010salt electrolyte. Consequently, SCL enables stable cycling of high\u2010loading (21.4\u00a0mg cm\u22122) practical NCM811/graphite full cells with 93.57% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high current density of 2.2\u00a0mA cm\u22122. This strategy enables selective electrochemical reactions through spatial confinement to enhance LIB performance, while suppressing side reactions and reducing costs, providing a scalable approach for next\u2010generation electrolyte design.",

This remodeling induces the reconstruction of band structure and the expansion of hexagonal region, which accelerates the movement of both electrons and ions within the material and electrode structures. The structural enhancement facilitates the fast\u2010charging and cycle stability of a pure silicon anode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSustainable electrification continues to drive growing interest in high\u2010performance lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs), which are essential energy storage systems for this transition. However, conventional graphite\u2010based LIBs cannot meet the stringent requirements of next\u2010generation applications, necessitating advanced alternatives. Herein, we report the design of fluorine\u2010incorporated silicon (FIS) nanostructures through a novel solid\u2013vapor\u2013solid synthesis method that integrates metallothermic reduction with combined top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up processes.

Interstitial F modifies the direct\u2010allowed band structure of Si and expands lithium penetration pathways, thereby enhancing charge transport through improved electronic conductivity and ion migration. Meanwhile, surface\u2010bound F induces superhydrophobicity, enabling hydrofluoric acid\u2010free processing during both synthesis and electrode fabrication.

    "content": "To further enhance the environmental sustainability and cost advantages of sodium\u2010ion batteries, it is essential to develop low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free layered oxide cathode materials. From the perspectives of cost and electrochemical performance, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in sodium\u2010ion batteries, with the resulting key scientific challenges and effective solution strategies summarized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) are the most widely used commercial rechargeable batteries, but the stable supply of key raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt faces challenges. Sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as potential alternatives and complements to LIBs due to similar working principles and the abundance of sodium resources. Layered oxide cathode materials (LOCMs) are recognized as one of the most promising practical cathodes for SIBs because of mature synthesis technology and satisfactory energy density. However, the use of nickel in LOCMs for SIBs has raised concerns about environmental pollution during nickel production and the risk of price volatility stemming from the widespread application of high\u2010nickel LOCMs for LIBs. Therefore, developing low\u2010cost nickel\u2010free LOCMs is crucial for enhancing the environmental friendliness and cost advantages of SIBs. For low\u2010cost LOCMs, this review discusses the feasibility of replacing Ni2+/Ni4+ with Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ for charge compensation in SIBs, and summarizes the resulting critical scientific challenges (Fe migration, Mn dissolution, Jahn\u2010Teller effect, Na deficiency, and thermal instability). Economic efficiency assessment based on cost and electrochemical properties indicates that low\u2010cost LOCMs exhibit the highest cost\u2010performance ratio. Finally, to accelerate the commercialization of cost\u2010effective SIBs technologies, this review outlines promising development pathways of low\u2010cost LOCMs.",

    "content": "This study reports an integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membrane fabricated via a bottom\u2010up relay phase inversion strategy, overcoming the long\u2010standing trade\u2010off in traditional porous membranes. Bilateral skin layers protect the macropore support layer, suppressing fouling and enhancing mechanical robustness. Tunable sub\u2010nanometer pores and an integrated symmetric architecture align well with flow batteries, enabling efficient and durable operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nA bottom\u2010up relay strategy is first proposed to fabricate integrated dual\u2010skin\u2010layer porous membranes (macropore layer between bilateral skin layers) by ingeniously introducing a non\u2010solvent carrier. Benefiting from the phase inversion relay process, bilateral skin layers can be tailored freely, where ethylene glycol in the non\u2010solvent carrier effectively regulates the structure of the bottom skin layer by adjusting the ratio of free water to bound water. Thus, a dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane is designed and applied in a vanadium flow battery (VFB), that features symmetric skin layers (\u223c600\u00a0nm) with sub\u2010nanometer (\u223c4.5\u00a0\u00c5) pores. The symmetric structure reduces the pressure required for proton migration via the Vehicle mechanism, and the sub\u2010nanometer pores effectively separate vanadium ions from protons by size exclusion, breaking the trade\u2010off in traditional membranes. Moreover, the bilateral skin layers protect the macropore layer against the vanadium fouling and mechanical damage. Furthermore, the formation mechanism and ion transport dynamics of the dual\u2010skin\u2010layer membrane are analyzed by molecular dynamics and multi\u2010physical field simulation. As a result, the optimized membrane enables stable VFB operation for over 6000 cycles at 200\u00a0mA cm\u22122 with energy efficiency of \u223c83.6%. This work provides an effective approach to prepare integrated symmetric membranes with bilateral skin layers.",

The fundamental mechanisms governing its high performance have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that centrosymmetry breaking in [001] preferentially oriented \u03b1\u2010FAPbI3 thin films (POF) arises from inevitable anisotropic strain during film formation. Using circular polarization\u2010dependent pump\u2010probe transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe Rashba\u2010type band splitting exclusively in POF, indicating symmetry breaking. Angle\u2010dependent X\u2010ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) reveal significant residual stress in POF compared to randomly oriented films (ROF), confirming strain\u2010induced lattice distortion. Furthermore, time\u2010resolved PL and microwave conductivity measurements reveal top\u2010back inhomogeneous carrier dynamics and anisotropic charge carrier mobility, supporting the presence of the anisotropic strain\u2010induced symmetry breaking.

However, the commercially used iridium\u2010based anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in PEMWEs still suffer from notably poor reactivity. At present, the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) is an important route to achieve both high activity and durability in OER. Nevertheless, the performance of conventional Ir\u2010based crystalline OER catalysts following the OPM pathway remains far below their theoretical limit, which is significantly hindered by two intrinsic limitations. First, their rigid lattice structures prevent the shortening of metal\u2010metal distances, which is essential to facilitate the rate\u2010determining O*\u2500O* dimerization. Second, the repulsion between O* adsorbates during OER inevitably weakens the metal = O* bond and undermines the overall oxygen evolution efficiency. Herein, we report that an amorphous IrMOx catalyst elegantly overcomes the limitations of the OPM pathway by virtue of its dynamic surface structure and strong oxophilicity of M.\u00a0 The dynamic surface structure promotes O*\u2500O* coupling, while the oxophilic nature of M compensates for the inherent weakening of the metal = O* bond during OER. Because of that, the catalyst exhibits outstanding OER performance, along with excellent catalytic durability over 1200 h\u2019 PEM testing.",

By encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles with an atomically thin carbon layer, the lattice expansion of Co3O4 during Kirkendall oxidation is constrained to a controllable strain range of 0.2\u20131.8%. This approach establishes a strain\u2010activity relationship for the oxygen evolution reaction in oxides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile Kirkendall oxidation (KO) facilely fabricates transition metal oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), it concomitantly triggers detrimental lattice expansion. For Co3O4, an appealing IrO2\u2010alternative catalyst, KO generates a free lattice expansion above 2.4%, resulting in suboptimal activity and stability. Here, we design a confined KO approach and coat the precursor Co nanoparticles with atomic carbon layers, enabling controllable lattice expansion of Co3O4 between 0.2% and 1.8%. For the first time, a strain\u2010dependent OER activity of Co3O4 is established in acidic media, with an expansion strain of 1.4% exhibiting the lowest overpotential of 377\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122.

    "content": "The densification process of Li6PS5Cl powders with varying particles size distributions reveals differences in smaller and larger distributions. Higher strain is revealed for the smaller particle size distribution from X\u2010ray diffraction. Discrete element method simulations uncover that the reason for the higher strain is not the particle size itself, but rather the larger inhomogeneity of particles in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSolid\u2010state battery fabrication requires the densification of solid electrolytes to achieve optimal cycling performance and high energy density. However, the underlying compaction mechanisms of these electrolytes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of pressure consolidation on the ionic conductor Li6PS5Cl with particle size distributions (PSD) ranging from 4 to 40 \u00b5m. Heckel analysis reveals that samples with smaller PSDs exhibit higher compressibility at lower pressures. X\u2010ray diffraction peak profiling shows that applied pressure induces lattice strain, leading to peak broadening, while pair distribution function analysis demonstrates a reduction in coherence length upon pressing. Dark\u2010field X\u2010ray microscopy further provides spatially resolved orientation maps, uncovering intragranular structural variations within individual Li6PS5Cl agglomerates after compression. To better understand the origin of stress fluctuations, we performed discrete element method simulations using the experimental PSDs. The results indicate that smaller particles and broader PSDs experience higher stresses, whereas monodisperse systems do not exhibit significant stress fluctuations with position or particle size. This suggests that the high strain observed cannot be attributed solely to smaller particles, but rather to size inhomogeneity. Overall, these findings highlight that both particle size and its distribution play a critical role in processing solid electrolytes for solid\u2010state batteries.",

The electrode demonstrates ultralow capacity decay during long\u2010term cycling in both potassium\u2010 and sodium\u2010ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPotassium\u2010ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium\u2010ion batteries (SIBs) are promising next\u2010generation energy storage technologies because of their abundant and low\u2010cost raw materials. However, anodes for PIBs/SIBs often exhibit poor cycling stability, mainly due to particle fragmentation, loss of electrical connectivity, and continuous electrolyte decomposition from repetitive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these challenges, a biomimetic pomegranate\u2010like core\u2010shell SnP2O7@PC anode (CSP\u2010SnP2O7@PC) is synthesised through pyrolysis\u2010driven Kirkendall effect of tin\u2010based phosphonate metal\u2010organic framework (MOF). This multi\u2010scale design integrates several key features. At the molecular scale, the in situ formation of Sn\u2010P\u2010O bonds reduces K+ diffusion barriers. The nanoscale dispersion of SnP2O7 within conductive carbon matrix promotes efficient electron and ion transport. Furthermore, microscale structural engineering creates pre\u2010reserved voids to accommodate volume expansion, suppress SEI overgrowth, and prevent cracking.
