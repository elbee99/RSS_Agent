    "content": "The thermal stability of sodium solid electrolytes, especially their reactivity with electrodes, remains unclear, hindering safety assessment. This work systematically compares six representative sodium SEs. While inorganic solid electrolytes are intrinsically thermally stable, their exothermic reactions with electrodes highlight that overall battery safety depends on electrode\u2010electrolyte thermal compatibility, not just electrolyte stability alone, providing new insights for ASSB safety design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010solid\u2010state batteries (ASSBs) are widely regarded as promising nextgeneration energy storage systems due to their high energy density and enhanced safety. Na\u2010based ASSBs, in particular, offer compelling advantages through the use of earth\u2010abundant and low\u2010cost materials. However, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding the thermal stability of sodium solid electrolytes (SEs)\u2014especially their reactivity with electrode materials\u2014hindering reliable safety assessment. Herein, we present a systematic comparison of the thermal behavior of six representative sodium SEs: Na3Zr2Si2PO12, Na3PS4, NaAlCl4, Na2ZrCl6, NaAlCl2.5O0.75, and PEO. While inorganic SEs demonstrate good intrinsic thermal stability, most exhibit significant exothermic reactions with cathode or anode materials upon heating, releasing considerable heat that could trigger thermal runaway. Notably, chloride\u2010based SEs show markedly different reactivities\u2014NaAlCl4 reacts violently with Na15Sn4, whereas Na2ZrCl6 remains remarkably stable, highlighting the crucial role of reaction kinetics and melting point in modulating thermal stability. The findings reveal that electrode\u2013electrolyte compatibility under thermal stress\u2014not just the stability of the SE alone\u2014is a decisive factor for ASSB safety. Our work underscores the critical role of electrode\u2010electrolyte thermal stability, offering new insights into the safety design of all\u2010solid\u2010state batteries.",

    "content": "In anode has been widely used in labs due to its stability. However, it still suffers failure at high current density and areal capacity. This work demonstrates the failure mechanism of In anode and propose protective layer by atomic layer deposition could effectively enhance the performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAlloy\u2010based anodes, particularly indium (In) are emerging as promising candidates for achieving long\u2010cycle life in all\u2010solid\u2010state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), due to their dendrite\u2010free characteristics and ability to stabilize the anode interface. However, their practical applications remain hindered by limitations in the failure of In anodes under high current densities and areal capacities, where the incomplete understanding of the underlying failure mechanism limits the optimization strategies. Herein, we employ advanced characterization techniques to systematically investigate the failure mechanisms of In anodes under high current densities and areal capacities. Our findings reveal that alloying and dealloying processes involve an electro\u2010chemo\u2010mechanical coupling failure mechanism and further exacerbate performance degradation. By elucidating these failure mechanisms, our work provides critical insights and rational surface protection strategies by ALD coating with Al2O3 layer for enhancing the interfacial stability and performance of alloy anodes in ASSLBs. The maximum cycling capacity of the Li/In asymmetric cell at 0.5\u00a0mA/cm2 was enhanced from 0.2 to 2 mAh/cm2 (>200 cycles). This work paves the way for the development of durable, high\u2010energy\u2010density batteries.",

    "content": "A molecular\u2010structure\u2010dependent redox\u2010mediated CO2 reduction reaction mechanism is proposed in aprotic Li\u2010CO2 batteries through a comparative investigation of model quinone (Q)\u2010based catalysts. It is revealed that the introduction of electron\u2010withdrawing groups (EWGs) into Q\u2010moiety enhances discharge potentials and Q\u2010CO2 adduct dissociation to form Li2CO3 and CO, while reducing CO2 binding affinity. Moderate EWG substitution balances CO2 affinity and adducts dissociation to improve discharge capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nRedox mediators (RMs) emerge as critical enablers for unlocking the energy potentials of aprotic Li\u2010CO2 batteries through solution\u2010mediated CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the structural effect of RMs on CO2RR pathways and catalytic efficiency remains insufficiently understood. Herein, through a comparative investigation of model quinone (Q)\u2010based RMs using in situ spectroscopic techniques coupled with theoretical calculations, it is revealed that reduced Q species chemically bind with CO2 to form metastable Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts (n, x = 1 or 2), which subsequently dissociate into LiCO2 intermediates and further generate Li2CO3 and CO as discharge product while regenerating LinQ (n = 0 or 1) for sustained redox cycling. The dissociation of Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts constitutes the rate\u2010determining step under non\u2010polarization conditions. The introduction of electron\u2010withdrawing groups (EWGs) into the Q moiety can enhance discharge potentials, but creates a kinetic trade\u2010off: increased dissociation kinetics of Lin(Q\u2010xCO2) adducts and suppressed adduct formation due to diminished CO2 binding affinity for reduced Q species. Strategic electronic modulation via optimized EWG substitution balances this CO2 affinity and adducts dissociation equilibrium, achieving simultaneous improvements in discharge potential and capacity. Our work provides fundamental guidelines for the rational design of advanced RMs in next\u2010generation Li\u2010CO2 batteries.",

    "content": "The strong oxophilicity of VM1 sites promotes H2O adsorption by interacting with its O atoms. Concurrently, photoholes accumulating at adjacent O\u2212 sites could be rapidly injected into these VM1 sites, facilitating H2O dissociation to produce protons. Moreover, the VM1 sites modulate the local coordination environment of neighboring M2 sites, which enhances the capture of photoelectrons, thereby boosting CO2 adsorption and activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nPhotocatalytic CO2 methanation is fundamentally constrained by two intertwined bottlenecks: inefficient proton generation from H2O dissociation and the premature desorption of the critical *CO intermediate. Here, we design metal cation vacancy clusters\u2010O\u2212 motifs for accelerating H2O dissociation and boosting *CO protonation, while supported metal sites for CO2 activation over metal\u2010anchored metal oxide nanosheets. As a prototype, we fabricate Au/TiO2\u2010VTi nanosheets, where synchrotron\u2010radiation X\u2010ray absorption fine structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirm VTi\u2010O\u2212 and coordination\u2010unsaturated Au sites. Density\u2010functional\u2010theory calculations reveal the creation of VTi\u2010O\u2212 sites drive the step of *CO protonation toward *CHO from an endothermic process (0.09\u00a0eV) to an exothermic one (\u22120.29\u00a0eV), and concurrently the energy for H2O dissociation into protons is lowered by a factor of two (1.31\u00a0eV \u2192 0.65\u00a0eV). In situ Fourier\u2010transform infrared spectroscopy directly captures a distinct *CO intermediate, confirming its stabilization on the photocatalyst surface and thereby promoting the protonation step toward *CHO. Consequently, the Au/TiO2\u2010VTi nanosheets show a superior CH4 formation rate of 156.5\u00a0\u00b5mol g\u22121 h\u22121 with near\u2010100% selectivity. Briefly, this work offers key insights into CO2 methanation bottlenecks and proposes a catalyst design blueprint to advance CO2 valorization.",

    "content": "An electronic regulation strategy was proposed to construct an electronic inversion layer (EIL) on interface between MOFs and Mxene, for enhancing the conductivity of MOFs, to optimize the lithium\u2010ion storage and cycling stability. The obtained MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx did well reduce polarization and facilitated the formation of the SEI. As a result, the composite achieved a capacity retention of 94% (450.3 mAh/g) after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMetal\u2010organic frameworks (MOFs) are rising stars for Li\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) electrodes. However, low conductivity of MOFs easily caused polarization and poor active site utilization. Here, an innovative electronic inversion layer (EIL) was proposed to guide the composite and interface design of MIL\u201053(Fe) with Ti3C2Tx, prompting a remarkable increase in the electrical conductivity of MIL\u201053(Fe) from 4.94 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5S/cm to 46.65 mS/cm (30\u00a0MPa). This enhancement is attributed to the EIL activated by Ti3C2Tx effectively shift the primary charge carriers from holes to high\u2010mobility electrons. Simultaneously, the localized EIL promoted the formation of a p\u2013n junction and establishes a hole concentration gradient in MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx, thereby accelerating lithium\u2010ion diffusion kinetics. Consequently, the MIL\u201053(Fe)@Ti3C2Tx delivered a superior capacity of 450.3 mAh/g at 1 A/g, and the possible retention of 94% capacity after 1000 cycles, exceeding those of the MIL\u201053(Fe) and Ti3C2Tx. This investigation into MXene\u2010activated EIL presents an innovative strategy and mechanism of universal significance for addressing the inherent conductivity challenges acted by a series of electrode materials, especially MOFs and COFs.",

    "content": "While perovskite solar cells have been widely studied, including their stability, perovskite indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) have only recently emerged. Nevertheless, more studies are appearing in the literature. The systematic stability study of IPVs is crucial, particularly given the inconsistencies in reported methodologies and results, which call for standardized protocols to build confidence in the field and advance the technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMetal halide perovskite indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are the top contenders in terms of efficiency among emerging IPV technologies. The state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art perovskite IPVs have already achieved reported efficiencies above 44%, indicating their significant potential. However, only a small percentage of reports discuss stability measurements, with approximately 7% adopting the International Summit on Organic PV Stability (ISOS) protocol for stability evaluation. A standard for the stability assessment of emerging thin film IPVs still lags. This research area remains largely unexplored, yet it is essential to the commercialization of IPV technologies. This review focuses on perovskite\u2010based IPVs, with an emphasis on device stability. It provides discussions of the origins of degradation in perovskite materials and their corresponding IPV devices. This is followed by an overview of various structure\u2013property\u2013stability strategies, including compositional, interface, and device\u00a0design engineering for perovskite materials to improve their performance. Finally, the review outlines some existing stability test protocols that could apply to perovskite IPVs, including addressing mitigation issues, such as encapsulation, draws the attention of researchers in the field, and calls for the development of standardized stability test protocols for perovskite IPVs and for understanding how these tests correlate with actual indoor lifespans to enable the commercialization of perovskite IPVs.",

    "content": "Key interfacial engineering strategies in PEM electrolyzers are illustrated, targeting four interfaces: gas diffusion layer\u2010catalyst, catalyst\u2010electrolyte, catalyst\u2010membrane, and membrane\u2010electrode assembly. These approaches promote CO2 delivery, suppress hydrogen evolution, balance local proton and ion transport, and stabilize microenvironments, enabling selective and durable CO2 electroreduction under acidic conditions at industrially relevant current densities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers offers a pathway to close the carbon cycle and produce sustainable fuels and chemicals at industrial\u2010scale current densities. Acidic operation enables compact reactor architectures and superior single\u2010pass carbon utilization, yet faces persistent challenges including parasitic hydrogen evolution, catalyst corrosion and deactivation, along with constrained local CO2 transport. This review highlights recent progress in interfacial microenvironmental engineering that reconcile acidic operation with selective and durable CO2 conversion. We organize strategies across four critical interfaces: (1) the gas diffusion layer\u2010catalyst layer interface, where engineered hydrophobicity and pore structure promote CO2 delivery while maintaining a stable three\u2010phase boundary; (2) the catalyst\u2010electrolyte electric double layer interface, where control over interfacial fields, pH gradients, and adsorbate binding energetics suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction while promoting CO2RR selectivity; (3) at the catalyst layer\u2010membrane interface, where optimized ionomer distribution and tailored proton conductivity balance local proton availability, mitigating catalyst degradation; and (4) the integrated membrane\u2010electrode assembly, where harmonized ion transport, CO2 flux, and electron conduction stabilizes the microenvironment for long\u2010term durability. By consolidating mechanistic insights and practical design principles, this review provides a roadmap for rational interfacial engineering to realize efficient, durable, and scalable acidic CO2 electroreduction in PEM electrolyzers.",

    "content": "This work develops a fluorinated hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (FHPE) through molecular\u2010scale organic/inorganic hybridization. The FHPE exhibits high Li+ conductivity (3.54 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121) at \u221230\u00b0C, and a wide voltage window (>4.7 V). It facilitates the formation of LiF\u2010rich interphases on the Li anode and LiCoO2 cathode. Li/LiCoO2 cells retain 86.7% capacity after 200 cycles at \u221230\u00b0C and 77.9% after 400 cycles at 60\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe development of wide\u2010temperature gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represents a promising strategy for enhancing the extreme environment tolerance of lithium\u2010metal batteries (LMBs), which requires simultaneously optimizing Li+ transport kinetics at low temperatures and maintaining the thermal and mechanical stability. This work addresses the intrinsic limitations of conventional GPEs by employing a molecular engineering strategy that achieves molecular\u2010scale hybridization of organic and inorganic units. Specifically, a fluorinated hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (FHPE) is fabricated through the in situ crosslinking polymerization of trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) and acryloxypropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (Acry\u2010POSS) within 2,2\u2010difluoroethyl acetate (DFEA). The FHPE displays high Li+ conductivity (3.54 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121 at \u221230\u00b0C), broad electrochemical stability window (>4.7\u00a0V), and remarkable mechanical strength (58.7\u00a0MPa). Moreover, the FHPE promotes the formation of LiF\u2010rich interphases on the LiCoO2 cathode and lithium metal anode, thereby effectively mitigating dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions. Consequently, FHPE\u2010based Li/Li coin cells stably cycle for 1500\u00a0h at 0.3\u00a0mA cm\u22122 and \u221230\u00b0C, while Li/LiCoO2 coin cells exhibit 86.7% capacity retention after 200 cycles at \u221230\u00b0C and 77.9% after 400 cycles at 60\u00b0C. Furthermore, Li/FHPE/LiCoO2 pouch cells exhibit stable operation during nail penetration tests, thereby confirming their exceptional safety.",

Using a newly designed electrochemical cell, this study demonstrates reversible Li+ insertion/extraction in a thick ASSB and enables operando neutron diffraction. The results reveal structural evolution and H1\u2010H2 phase coexistence in LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622), while confirming the stability of the argyrodite solid electrolyte.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAll\u2010Solid\u2010State Batteries (ASSBs) are promising emerging devices for meeting high\u2010energy demands and an in\u2010depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms occuring during their operation will help in their design for better performance. In this context, neutrons, with their high penetration depth and sensitivity to light elements such as lithium, provide a powerful tool for investigating the structural mechanisms occurring in bulk ASSBs, while the electrochemical operation of large batteries (required for neutron diffraction) remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate the reversible electrochemical Li+ extraction/insertion within a 2.5\u00a0mm thick ASSB system comprising 140\u00a0mg of LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) as the positive electrode material (238 mWh energy density), Li5.4PS4.4BrCl0.6 (LPSClBr) as the solid electrolyte and Li0.5In as the negative electrode. Thanks to the use of the newly\u2010designed ILLBAT#5 electrochemical cell, we were able to perform operando neutron powder diffraction (NPD) of the system, which coupled with ex situ diffraction, allowed us to gain valuable insights into the structural evolution of NMC622 within the ASSB as well as to probe the structural stability of the Argyrodite solid electrolyte throughout the initial cycle. Herein, we report on the formation and the co\u2010existence of H1\u2010H2 phases in NMC622, attributed to system inhomogeneity.",

    "content": "Halide segregation (HS) in mixed\u2010halide wide\u2010bandgap (WBG) perovskites is key to the stability of perovskite\u2010based tandem cells and a central focus of large\u2010scale research efforts. Here, we find that the underlying reason for the poor stability of cells prone to HS is enhanced ionic losses during operation. Furthermore, we identified irreversible ionic losses as a decisive factor for operational stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHalide segregation (HS) is considered to be one of the most significant hurdles for the commercialization of tandem solar cells. However, despite significant research on this matter, the exact impact of HS on the performance degradation and the ion density evolution is yet to be established. In this work, we investigate the intriguing correlation between HS, ion\u2010induced efficiency losses, and ion density evolution in wide\u2010bandgap (WBG) triple cation perovskite cells. Our results highlight that all three phenomena evolve on similar timescales and follow the same trend across all studied bandgaps. This implies that the poor energy\u2010lifetime product observed for devices prone to halide segregation is a result of enhanced ionic losses rather than, for instance, charge carrier funneling. Furthermore, reminiscent of the recovery of HS observed previously, we demonstrate that ionic losses also recover after light exposure and dark storage, which occurs along with a receding ion density. However, we also observe irreversible ionic losses, especially after prolonged illumination, which are critical for device operation. These findings present an important new understanding of the interplay between halide segregation and ionic processes and provide a rational explanation for the performance and stability of mixed halide WBG perovskites.",

The design integrates a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with a cation\u2010infused sandwich architecture and incorporates a filter paper interlayer between the GDE and SSE layer to enhance selectivity and stability. With commercial Bi, the reactor achieves a single\u2010pass formic acid concentration of 1.5\u00a0m, a Faradaic efficiency of 63.6%, and a stable operation for 150 h at 100\u00a0mA cm\u22122. Scalability is further demonstrated using a 100 cm2 prototype. In situ electrochemical analyses reveal that the sandwich\u2010structured GDE promotes localized alkalinity, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. An integrated Power\u2010to\u2010Protein framework is also proposed, coupling electrochemical formic acid production with yeast\u2010based protein biosynthesis. These findings underscore the potential of biohybrid systems to couple renewable energy\u2010driven CO2 valorization with sustainable protein production, advancing the development of circular carbon\u2013energy biomanufacturing pathways.",

The strong electron\u2010withdrawing effect of the \u2013CF3 group reduces electron density at metal centers and stabilizes high\u2010valent Ni/Fe species, which suppresses NiOOH formation and mitigates OH\u2013 oversaturation. This electronic redistribution simultaneously activates lattice oxygen reactivity and promotes selective urea oxidation, ultimately leading to superior activity and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nElectrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis, enabling simultaneous energy\u2010efficient hydrogen production and urea\u2010rich wastewater remediation. However, sluggish kinetics and the inevitable competition from OER, especially at high anodic potentials, continue to impede its practical application. Herein, we report a ligand\u2010engineered NiFe layered double hydroxide intercalated with trifluoroacetate (CF3COO\u2013), termed CF3\u2010LDH, to address these limitations. Leveraging the strong electron\u2010withdrawing nature of the \u2013CF3 group, CF3COO\u2013 drives electron transfer from Ni and Fe centers to the ligand, thereby lowering the local electron density, stabilizing high\u2010valent Ni(2+\u03b4)+ and Fe(3+\u03b1)+ species, and unlocking the reactivity of adjacent lattice oxygen sites. In situ spectroscopic analyses reveal that CF3COO\u2013 intercalation suppresses NiOOH formation and mitigates OH\u2013 oversaturation, thus attenuating the parasitic OER pathway and ensuring UOR selectivity. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the lattice oxygen sites with engineered p\u2010orbital occupancy reduce the energy barriers of key UOR steps and optimize the adsorption of critical intermediates. As a result, CF3\u2010LDH exhibits superior UOR activity, requiring only 1.32\u00a0V to reach 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 with a Tafel slope of 29\u00a0mV\u00a0dec\u22121.

Despite considerable performance progress through sophisticated material design and elaborate structure optimization, the frequency mismatch between mechanical energy sources in natural scenario and the PENG device remains a crucial issue causing low energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique mechanical excitation pattern that employs a spring\u2010induced impact force applied to electrospun flexible BaTiO3/PVDF nanocomposite film to maximize the output power of PENG. Compared with the conventional compression mode, this instantaneous stress ejection effectively reduces the force response time from 6.0 to 0.5\u00a0ms to achieve frequency up\u2010conversion, as evidenced by a real\u2010time synchronized force\u2010current curve. Moreover, the impact force enhances the separation of positive and negative polarity of the piezoelectric electron cloud and contributes to generating more piezoelectric charges.

This work demonstrates that synergistic Li and Ti co\u2010doping enhances sodium inventory, suppresses detrimental phase transitions, and activates reversible lattice oxygen redox. The combined cation\u2013anion redox mechanism delivers improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability for sodium\u2010ion battery cathodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nSodium layered oxides NaxMO2 (x \u2264 1 and M = transition metal ions) have gained significant interest as sodium\u2010ion battery (NIB) cathodes owing to their high operating voltages and potential for higher energy density compared with polyanion and Prussian blue\u2013type cathodes. However, their practical applications are often hindered by the irreversible structural transitions leading to capacity fading during cycling. The nature and substitution of transition metal ions define the material properties and electrochemical performance. In this study, through comprehensive electrochemical characterization combined with multi\u2010scale structural and spectroscopical analyses, we demonstrate the synergistic impacts of Lithium and Titanium doping, which not only increases overall capacity by boosting cation and anion cooperative redox contributions but also improves the rate capability and cycling stability. Specifically, Li+ doping enhances the available sodium inventory for extraction, while Ti4+ disrupts Na+/vacancy ordering at lower voltages (< 4\u00a0V) and mitigates the detrimental P2\u2192OP4/O2 phase transition during cycling. The combined effect of Lithium and Titanium doping promotes more charge localization on Oxygen, which activates reversible lattice oxygen redox reactions at elevated voltages, contributing additional capacity beyond conventional cationic redox. This work provides crucial insights into the design of high\u2010performance, high\u2010capacity P2\u2010type layered cathode materials for sodium\u2010ion batteries.",

The report explores the intersection of defect engineering and SACs, providing an in\u2010depth mechanistic perspective on how structural defects can be harnessed to enhance the catalytic performance of SACs in photochemical and electrochemical CO2RR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the past few years, a wide array of heterogeneous single\u2010atom catalysts (SACs) has attracted researchers due to their exceptional performance in CO2 reduction. However, the role of defects in escalating the catalytic activity of SACs remains enigmatic. Through this review, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the interplay between defects and catalytic activity in SACs. Despite remarkable advancements, a significant lacuna persists in fully elucidating the dynamic role of defects under operational conditions. This necessitates an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to guide the rational design of next\u2010generation SACs for CO2 conversion. Therefore, we aim to account for mechanistic insights into SAC\u2010led photochemical and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) without deviating from our objective of ascertaining the causes behind their catalytic efficiency due to defect engineering. The mechanistic toolkit derived from operando characterizations, density functional theory, and machine learning is provided to correlate defect\u2010engineered SACs with improved activity and selectivity for CO2conversion.",

However, traditional electrolytes suffer from poor thermal stability and severe side reactions at temperatures above 60\u00b0C, failing to meet the practical use under high\u2010temperature conditions.

    "content": "An electrostatic repulsion strategy is developed to mitigate PA poisoning in HT\u2010PEMFCs by constructing a localized negative charge environment around Pt active sites. The resulting Pt/C\u2010SO catalyst enables HT\u2010PEMFC to deliver 1166 mW cm\u22122 peak power density, and exceptional durability (over 500\u2010h) with an ultra\u2010low voltage decay of 26 \u00b5V h\u22121.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh\u2010temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT\u2010PEMFCs) suffer from severe performance degradation caused by phosphoric acid (PA) poisoning, which remains a critical challenge for practical applications. Unlike conventional techniques, herein, an electrostatic repulsion strategy is proposed to mitigate this issue by repelling the primary poisoning species (H2PO4\u2212) away from Pt active sites through the construction of a local negative charge environment. To realize this concept, oxidized sulfur (SOx) groups are precisely incorporated into carbon support to generate localized negative electrostatics around Pt. Spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculations reveal strong Pt\u2010support interactions that spatially enable electrostatic repulsion. As a result, the as\u2010prepared Pt/C\u2010SO catalyst exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction activity and outstanding durability in PA\u2010containing electrolytes, far outperforming commercial Pt/C. When applied in HT\u2010PEMFC, the Pt/C\u2010SO catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1166\u00a0mW cm\u22122 and maintains stable operation for over 500\u00a0h of continuous operation at 500\u00a0mA cm\u22122, with an ultra\u2010low voltage decay rate of 26 \u00b5V h\u22121, which is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercial Pt/C (1075 \u00b5V h\u22121). This study provides a mechanistically grounded and practically feasible approach to overcoming PA poisoning and durability limitations of Pt\u2010based catalysts in HT\u2010PEMFCs.",

Here, this work presents an electric field\u2013driven in situ strategy to construct a vertically graded interphase using an oxygen\u2010rich nanodiamond/carbon (O\u2010ND/C) composite. During Li plating, conductive carbon migrates toward the current collector, forming a C\u2010enriched conductive sublayer beneath a lithiophilic O\u2010ND\u2010rich insulating layer. This bilayer architecture homogenizes Li\u2010ion flux, lowers the nucleation barrier, and simultaneously ensures mechanical robustness and electronic insulation, thereby enabling dendrite\u2010free Li deposition. The optimized O\u2010ND with 10 wt% of C interphase demonstrates outstanding electrochemical stability, maintaining an ultralow overpotential of 9.5\u00a0mV for 5800\u00a0h in symmetric cells and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.8% to 700 cycles. In full\u2010cell configurations with LiFePO4 cathodes, stable operation is sustained for up to 1500 cycles, areal capacity of 12.1 mAh cm\u22122 retained 9.9 mAh cm\u22122 after 50 cycles even under industrially relevant high cathode loading (93.8 mgLFP cm\u22122). Complementary density functional theory calculations confirm that O\u2010ND surfaces enhance Li adsorption and diffusion, corroborating the experimental results.
